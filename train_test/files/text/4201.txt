Background
Research estimates that visual hallucinations (VHs) occur in
patients who have Parkinson's disease (PD) with a preva-
lence that ranges from 8% to 40%, (Barnes & David, 2001)
and give rise to an extremely common and often distressing
psychiatric disturbance in patients (Aarsland et al., 1999).
Although the exact cognitive mechanisms that are necessary
for VHs to occur have not yet been determined, many differ-
ent lines of evidence are emerging, indicating that hallucina-
tions show a relationship with sleep disturbances and
cognitive disruption (Barnes, Connelly, Wiggs, Boubert, &
Maravic, 2010; Goetz, Wuu, Curgian, & Leurgans, 2005;
Holroyd, Currie, & Wooten, 2001; Manford & Andermann,
1998). A complex variety of hallucinations associated with
PD most commonly consist of animals and living or deceased
individuals, who may or may not be known to the patient.
Typically, the hallucinated figures appear suddenly, in dim
light, with the patient's eyes open (Barnes & David, 2001).
Other types of hallucinatory phenomena reported in PD
involve hallucinations that are initiated by aspects of the
environment, which then morph and change into other forms.
These VHs generally involve seeing an inanimate object as a
living entity, such as a street light becoming a flying bird, or
a dusty floor appearing as a swarm of spiders.
Francis Galton emphasized the connection of all types of
visualization, whether externally stimulus driven or internally
memory driven (Galton, 1883). Indeed, one could also delin-
eate VHs as internally driven where they consist of familiar
objects and people, whereas externally driven processes could
create cognitive illusions and VHs of unfamiliar people not
present in memory. Neurologically speaking, sensations, men-
tal imagery, daydreams, dreams, and hallucinations are similar
in the sense that they are all internally driven processes.
Perceptions are externally driven cognitive constructions,
assembled from raw sensory data that are united with memory
to form a conscious awareness of the external environment.

Phenomenology of Visual Hallucinations
and Their Relationship to Cognitive
Profile in Parkinson's Disease Patients:
Preliminary Observations
Laura Boubert1 and James Barnes2
Abstract
Although the phenomenology of visual hallucinations (VHs) has been investigated, no study to date has related cognitive
performance to the content of hallucinations, specifically whether participants who have familiar internally driven hallucinations
differ in the executive function from patients with externally driven hallucinations. Here, we examine the relationship between
executive function and the content of VHs in Parkinson's disease (PD) patients. We evaluated three groups: 17 PD patients
with internally driven memory-based VHs, 18 PD patients with externally driven non-memory-based VHs, and 20 PD patients
without hallucinations on a series of tests previously reported to evaluate executive functions, specifically tests of inhibitory
ability, short-term memory, and working memory. Differences were found on test of inhibitory ability with PD patients
experiencing externally driven VHs having substantially greater impairment than patients with internally driven VHs. These
findings indicate that the cognitive profile of patients may influence the content of the hallucinatory experience and could
consequently have implications for treatment of the phenomenon.

(memory) inputs to the cerebral mechanisms that construct
our conscious experience is constantly shifting and it is the
competition between these internal and external inputs for
access to this central awareness system that could be leading
to the possibility of perceptual memories, imagery, and hal-
lucinations to become indistinguishable from real events.
Memory function and attention are two possible facilitat-
ing or causative factors of VHs in PD, as the hallucinating
individuals become less able of telling the difference between
perceived and imaginary events, they are unable to attend
adequately to visual stimuli relying instead on memory for
identification, hence hindering their ability to distinguish
between perceived and imaginary experiences (Barnes,
Boubert, Harris, Lee, & David, 2003). Evidence also sug-
gests a correlation between VHs and an overall reduction in
the ability to process information (Collerton, Perry, &
McKeith, 2005). Indeed, executive functions are reportedly
involved in reality monitoring and contribute significantly to
disentangling visual perception (Barnes & Boubert, 2008),
from determining external and internal stimuli, to the inter-
nal production of a visual image (Grossi et al., 2005; Roth,
Johnson, Raye, & Constable, 2009). If this reality monitor-
ing process is inadequate, it might lead to confusion when
distinguishing what is virtual from what is real, thereby con-
tributing to the experience of hallucinations (Bentall, Baker,
& Havers, 1991). This process could possibly account for
hallucinatory syndromes in psychotic conditions as well as
neurodegenerative diseases (Brebion, Ohlsen, Pilowsky, &
David, 2008). Nonetheless, some aspects of the content (e.g.,
the predominance of significant or remembered people or
animals) and some aspects of emotional significance suggest
that higher level cognitive factors may well also play a role
in the hallucinatory process.
Previous work with Parkinson's patients has led to an
observation that the hallucinatory phenomenon is quite ste-
reotyped in a given patient. In most instances, hallucinations
may be categorized as being an internally driven memory-
based hallucination process, where individuals see images of
loved ones or people that they know, or an externally driven
non-memory-based hallucination, which consists of strangers
or bizarre images. Although a previous study has investigated
patients with a variety of hallucinations and found impaired
inhibitory and executive functions, the study made no attempt
to characterize the phenomenological content of the patient's
hallucinatory experience (Barnes & Boubert, 2008).
Based on the above considerations, this present study
aimed to extend these observations by investigating if there
are any cognitive differences in patients with internally
driven hallucinations and patients who experience externally
driven hallucinations. We predicted that patients with
internal driven hallucinations would have more memory-
associated impairments than patients with externally driven
hallucinations and no hallucinations. In addition, we expected
patients with the externally driven type of hallucinations to
show less memory deficits and have more difficulty with
tasks requiring an intentional component.
Method
All of the methods described below were formally approved
by Oxford Brookes University Health and Life Sciences eth-
ics committee.
Participants
Individuals with PD currently experiencing VHs were
recruited using a questionnaire, which asked about VHs and
visual disturbances (Barnes & David, 2001). All patients had
a presumptive clinical diagnosis of PD and participants were
selected on the basis of whether they were experiencing
internally based VHs (n = 17), or externally driven hallucina-
tions (n = 18; see Table 1). In addition, a group of patients
who had never experienced VHs were recruited (N = 20).
The selection of individuals with VHs was based on (a) the
frequency of hallucinations (>1 per day) and (b) the absence
of epilepsy or cognitive impairment (Mini Mental State
Examination (MMSE) > 25; Folstein, Robins, & Helzer,
1983). Participants were recruited with case notes and the
help of neurologists and ophthalmologists to ensure that no
participant had a clinical diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease,
Lewy body dementia, or any current or past history of eye
disease. Individuals were assigned to groups according to
whether their VHs were internally or externally driven and
they must have had them occurring within the last month.
The control patients with PD who had never hallucinated
were matched with those with VHs for age and disease sever-
ity, as well as medication dosage (see Table 2).
Cognitive Assessment
All patients who enrolled in the study underwent a psycho-
logical assessment, which included screening tests for gen-
eral cognitive abilities. The cognitive tests used were the
same as in a previous study investigating executive function-
ing in PD patients (Barnes & Boubert, 2008). The National
Adult Reading Test (NART) was utilized as a general cogni-
tive screening test (Nelson, 1982). Depressed mood was
measured with the 21-item Beck Depression Inventory
(Beck, Ward, Mendelson, Mock, & Erbaugh, 1961).
Several tests to explore selective cognitive deficits were
also selected. Tests of inhibitory ability included category
fluency (Newcombe, 1969), which was measured by asking
the participants to produce as many words as possible in 60 s
from the six categories of furniture, fruit, animals, tools,
items of clothing, and insects.
In addition, a standard color Stroop task was carried out
(Golden, 1978). This task consisted of 100 stimuli for each
subtask. Two control trials were performed first to act as a
baseline measure and control for the individual differences in
reading speed and color naming. The participants were
instructed to read the words, name the colors, and finally,
name the ink color of the printed words as quickly and as
accurately as possible; the times needed to complete each
Boubert and Barnes 3
Stroop subtask served as dependent measures (Stroop I,
Stroop II, and Stroop III, respectively). The interference
measure was calculated by subtracting the average time
needed to complete the first two subtasks from the time
needed to complete the third subtask (Interference = Stroop
III ­ [(Stroop I + Stroop II) / 2]; Valentijn et al., 2005).
Participants underwent tests of short-term memory. Digit
span Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (WAIS-III) was
tested by the presentation of digit strings presented orally at
a rate of one digit per second. Participants were given two
attempts at each digit string length and were instructed to
repeat the digits in the same order as they had been presented.
Word span was tested using one-syllable concrete nouns, and
participant word span was administered in the same way as
digit span. The longest string administered was nine words.
A 2-back task was also run (Cohen et al., 1997). This was
a computerized task in which the participants were presented
with four-letter abstract nouns one at a time at a rate of one
word every 2 s and asked to press one button whenever the
current stimulus matched the stimulus that had been shown
to them 2 s before. A second button was pressed whenever
the stimulus was not a match.
Reading span and word span tasks were also administered
to each participant (Barnes & Boubert, 2008). To measure
reading span, participants read aloud a sentence presented to
them on a computer screen. They were then asked to answer
a straightforward comprehension question about the sen-
tence. This was then repeated with another sentence, after
which participants were asked to recall the final word of each
sentence. Participants performed five sets of two-sentence
presentations. The word span task was presented in the same
way as the digit span task with the longest string being nine
words. All words were one-syllable, concrete nouns.
Results
Participant's demographics and a comparison of tests are
summarized in Table 2. An analysis of variance (ANOVA)
was performed on the scores obtained for each test consider-
ing the effect of the group with post hoc pairwise Tukey's
test to examine significant main effects. Table 2 summarizes
the results.
Tests of Inhibition
Significant group effects were found in all tests on inhibitory
ability (see Table 2). Stroop inference scores produced sig-
nificant group effects, F(2, 54) = 33.67, p< .001, with the
externally driven hallucinating patients performing at a
lower level than internally driven hallucinating patients and
normal controls, t(33) = 5.05, p< .001 and t(36) = 8.03, p<
.001, respectively. On fluency perseverations, the group
effect, F(2, 54) = 20.98, p< .001, indicated that the group
experiencing externally driven hallucinations made more
perseverations than those without hallucinations and the group
with patients experiencing internally driven hallucinations.

Tests of Working Memory
The ANOVA conducted on the corrected hit rate scores indi-
cated a significant effect of group, F(2, 54) = 20.59, p< .001,
with both hallucinating groups performing poorly when com-
pared with the control group. There was an effect of groups
regarding the percentage of hits, F(2, 54) = 5.87, p< .01, with
the control group performing to a higher standard than the PD
groups experiencing hallucinations. There was also a group
effect on false alarm data, F(2, 54) = 5.62, p< .01, with the
hallucinating groups again performing worse than the non-
hallucinating group. The analyses of reading span indicated a
significant group effect, F(2, 54) = 14.05, p< .001, showing
that the PD groups with hallucinations performed at a lower
standard than the non-hallucinating group.
Tests of Short Term Memory
With regard to digit span, the PD groups with hallucinations
did not perform as well as the non-hallucinating groups, F(2,
54) = 14.06, p< .001. Word span results indicated that patients
with internally driven hallucinations had significantly worse
performances on the task than individuals with externally
driven hallucinations and non-hallucinating controls, F(2,
54) = 15.25, p< .001.
Discussion
The aim of this study was to investigate whether there would
be any cognitive differences in patients with internally driven
hallucinations that involve top-down cognitive processes and

patients who experience externally driven hallucinations that
may be more associated with perceptual and attention mech-
anisms. Patients with externally driven VHs were impaired
on all three tests of inhibitory ability when compared against
the PD patients with internally generated VHs and also
against the controls.
The phenomenological complexity of VHs in PD has
been previously highlighted with a number of reoccurring
characteristics and clustered experiences being identified
(Barnes & David, 2001). In particular, the notion of veridical
perceptions changing in some way when observed by the
patient into certain common VHs such as faces, spiders, and
shapes that take on the form of people is a common factor in
this study. Less common, and consequently the more diffi-
cult individuals to find and engage are the patients who have
hallucinations of identifiable persons or animals and scenes
from episodic memory being played back to them in a par-
ticular way time after time. Past research has identified that
the content of the hallucination seems to be reflective of the
functional specializations of the particular part of the cere-
bral cortex with phenomenological variables clustering into
three main symptoms (Santhouse, Howard, & Ffytche,
2000). The ventral temporal lobe is associated with the group
of hallucinations consisting of extended landscape scenes,
children, and figures. The second group of hallucinations
consisting of faces is associated with the superior temporal
sulcus, whereas the third group of palinopsia and continu-
ance of visual sensation in the periphery of the visual field is
related to the dorsal parietal lobe.
In this study, we observed patients typically experiencing
well-formed VHs, consisting of humans and animals, which
can be related to dysfunction of the ventral temporal lobe;
however, as seen here from the documentation of patient
experiences (see Table 1), the content of the hallucination
can also be highly personalized and involve episodic memo-
ries. In these cases of internally driven hallucinations, the
images often expressed seem to be related to how the person
thinks or feels about past events. Here, some Parkinson's
patients viewed the content of their hallucinations to be
meaningful and to have particular relevance to them. The
images within their hallucination played out as memories
and manifested as recognizable people and events, which in
many cases intensified their experiences of the hallucinatory
event. Although the inhibitory ability might indeed repre-
sent a significant role in the phenomenology of externally
driven hallucinations, this does not imply that the proposed
inhibitory disturbances are the sole factors in producing the
hallucinatory experience. The exact processes that underlie
VHs remain largely unidentified, but center around two
main avenues of research; one focuses on the neuroanatomi-
cal networks and pathways using brain imaging techniques,
whereas the other focuses on cognitive and psychological
processes along with the study of mental events involved in
VHs.
Previous work with PD patients experiencing VHs has
found intact visual imagery, but poor executive function
(Barnes & Boubert, 2008), and poor object perception when
"switching" between modalities at study and test stages
(Barnes et al., 2003). Together, these studies implicate inhibi-
tory control as a factor in the hallucinatory phenomenon.
However, they did not, unlike the present study, separate hal-
lucinators based on phenomenological characteristics, so
although inhibitory mechanisms are implicated, they may
play a large role in externally driven hallucinations. These
current findings therefore highlight the complexity of the
processes involved and perhaps the need to characterize the
hallucinating individual more precisely before we can exam-
ine the cognitive mechanisms implicated. Internally driven
hallucinations in individuals may be a result of a failure to
identify events as self-driven and could occur because of
specific deficits in episodic memory. In this study, patients
with these hallucinations had a particular deficient short-
term memory for words but not digits. This behavioral pat-
tern may be a result of tasks difficulty, but still requires
further investigation. Specific deficits in memory may cause
confusion regarding the origins of the experience. In support
of this premise, findings suggest that PD patients with VHs
tend to misidentify the origins and source of stimuli during
memory events (Barnes et al., 2003). From a neuroanatomi-
cal viewpoint, deficits in the executive function of patients
with VHs are consistent with the notion of cognitive inhibi-
tory deficits; indeed, the disruption of executive functions in
PD patients has previously been reported (Brown, Schneider,
& Lidsky, 1997), and there is evidence of hippocampal
involvement in PD with VHs that could link the deficits seen
here with the internally driven subtype (Ibarretxe-Bilbao
et al., 2008).
The challenge in this area is in determining whether or not
these cognitive deficits are dissociable between patients with
different types of hallucinatory experiences. This study has
highlighted that inhibitory control may have a greater asso-
ciation with hallucinations that manifest themselves from
environmental stimuli and may well be initiated in a bottom-
up approach from environmental cues. Indeed, the Perception
and Attention Deficit (PAD) model of VHs proposes that a
combination of attention deficits and abnormal object per-
ception is necessary in the occurrence of recurrent complex
VHs (Collerton et al., 2005). Problems with inhibitory con-
trol have been linked to a disruption of striatal-dopaminergic
projections thought to be particularly salient for selective
attention (Casey, Durston, & Fossella, 2001; Casey,
Tottenham, & Fossella, 2002). Furthermore, we hypothesize
that there may well be a functional lack of connectivity
between the frontal and posterior areas in visually hallucinat-
ing patients that manifest themselves as a lack of frontal
modulatory control of over activation within the visual cor-
tex; subsequently, events that arise are not synchronized
normally.

Conclusion
A question raised by the results of this study is the degree to
which cognitive impairments seen in PD patients are a uni-
form set of factors and to what extent are these factors ulti-
mately responsible for VHs. It seems that not only do
psychological factors, such as beliefs and attributions, need
to be considered when approaching this question, but also
the possibility that differing cognitive profiles of the indi-
viduals, which have been highlighted here, may play a key
modulatory role in shaping the hallucinatory experience.
Perhaps further speculation on this issue should be
withheld until a replication of these findings has been
produced.

Author Biographies
Laura Boubert is a chartered psychologist and an associate fellow of
the British Psychological Society (BPS). Her research interests
focus on neuropsychological aspect of cognition, including the role
of executive functions in a range of cognitive processes, in particu-
lar visual perception, language processing and memory. Her
research spans both the normal population and clinical patients,
with an emphasis on sub groups of the population such as bilinguals
and those prone to hallucinations. Her educational research includes
various aspects of HE, but most recent projects have focused on the
role of technology in student learning.
James Barnes is a chartered psychologist and an associate fellow
of the British Psychological Society (BPS). His personal research
interests focus on the neuropsychological aspect of cognition, par-
ticularly psychosis and deviant behaviours in both clinical patients
and the general population. He has been involved in a variety of
projects working with individuals with Parkinson's disease, dys-
lexia, PTSD and more recently as a member of the National Centre
of Cyberstalking Research (NCCR) investigating the psychologi-
cal and neurobiological aspects of stalking behaviour.
