Introduction
The past research on education based on the Islamic tradi-
tional heritage has predominantly dealt with various chal-
lenges in the education system. However, the present global
educational situations occasionally give cause for concern.
Scholars are reviewing the current educational conditions to
influence alternative policy making in educational institu-
tions. In the Islamic context, there are equally many interre-
lated issues that have been carefully reviewed (Halstead,
2004). Consequently, Muslim scholars have advocated that
an education system that is oriented toward the understand-
ing of life both here and the hereafter should be prioritized in
Muslim societies.
By providing the guidelines that enhance the promotion
of the individual's physical and ethical character, Islamic
education could be conceived as a process of learning that
shapes and transforms the individual's intellectual experi-
ences and social behavior (al-Syaibany, 1979). Quality edu-
cation is determined by not only individual human factors,
but also external conditions including the educational envi-
ronment. For instance, the educational environment plays a
significant role in shaping the individual's character (whether
as a child or as an adult). The conditions of the educational
environment has an impact on the attainment of the goals of
education because they augment the effort of the teachers in
imparting values to the students. It is an established fact that
education is obligatory on all Muslims, male or female.
Despite that, for al-Zarnj, quality learning has certain
requirements that must be considered before it can be
achieved. Indeed, knowledge acquisition is a process that is
made up of progressive steps each of which has its own
requirements (i.e., what has to be fulfilled before the student
can progress to that level). Therefore, while students are
expected to fulfill certain requirements before progressing to
every level, the institutions should themselves design the
principles as well as the effective ways to apply them for bet-
ter results at each of these levels.
Al-Zarnj's Ta`lm al-Muta`allim provides valuable
insights into the essential principles of teaching and learning,
which could still be useful for both students and teachers and,
for that matter, Islamic educational institutions. Thus, the

Understanding Comprehensive Learning
Requirements in the Light of al-Zarnj's
Ta`lm al-Muta`allim

Abstract
This article examines the requirements for quality learning in Islam from the perspective of al-Zarnj and according to his
book, Ta`lm al-Muta`allim. This book has been a source of reference for both students and teachers in many educational
institutions in Muslim countries, particularly, the Islamic boarding schools in Indonesia. The article attempts to understand
the students' learning requirements proposed by al-Zarnj in the above treatise. It is, therefore, a library-based research.
The research tackles many issues. It addresses the need for a broad-based learning process and analyzes the requirements
in the light of the modern day learning circumstances. It was found that al-Zarnj's theory of quality learning is conditional
on six main principles which are, indeed, determinants of quality student outcomes. These are intelligence or high learning
ability; high motivation for learning; patience, emotional stability, and commitment to the learning process; availability of
financial support; inspiration of the teachers; and disposition to time management in the learning process. The notion of
quality education is fundamental to the classical perspective of learning in Islam.

2 SAGE Open
(2015b) have outlined, are as follows. First, its principles
have been applied in designing many policies in educational
institutions in the Muslim world, particularly the pesantren in
Indonesia. Second, its model of teaching and learning is suit-
able for achieving the aim of Islamic education. Finally, the
content of the book forms the basic foundation of the current
education system in Muslim countries. Therefore, in the light
of the contemporary educational circumstances, this article
isolates and examines the requirements that, according to the
book, students and, to a large extent, teachers must fulfill to
be able to engage in and promote quality learning from the
Islamic perspective.
Brief Biography of Al-Zarnj and a
Glimpse of His Ta`lm Al-Muta`allim
Al-Zarnj was born in Zarnuj (Athiyatullah, 1970), a small
town in Eastern Turkistan, a state adjoining River Tigris. He
was one of the Islamic educational philosophers (and, indeed,
one of the pioneers in the field of Islamic education) who
lived in the 13th century during the Abbasid regime. He
belonged to the Hanaf School of Islamic jurisprudence. He
outlined his educational thought in the treatise entitled,
Ta`lim al-Muta`allim, in which he explores the ethical guide-
lines both the teacher (the mu`allim) and the student (the
muta`allim) could follow to achieve better results in the
teaching and learning process. Al-Zarnj is associated with
two names (Athiyatullah, 1970). One is honorific (i.e.,
Burhn al-Dn) while the other is his actual name (i.e., Tj
al-Dn Nu`mn b. Ibrhm b. al-Khall al-Zarnj;
Muizzuddin, 2012).
He is reported to have understudied and corresponded
with several scholars during the period of his learning.
However, the following appear to be the most popular
(Ahmad, 1986).
1. Fakhr al-Islm al-H
. asan Ibn Mansr al Farghn
Khadikan (1196 ce);
2. Zahir al-Dn al-H
. asan Ibn `Al al-Marghinan, (1204
ce);
3. Fakhr al Dn al Kashan (1191 ce);
4. Burhn al-Dn `Al ibn Ab Bakr al-Farghinan
al-Marghinan (1195 ce);
5. Rukn al-Dn Muh
.ammad b. Ab Bakr Khwarzade
(491-576 AH; Afandi, 1993).
It is reported that by 1203, al-Zarnj had compiled all the
13 chapters of this book. For this reason, many of his biogra-
phers argue that the book was written in the 13th century
(Athiyatullah, 1970). However, it appears that much of the
work was done earlier. In any case, it is a widely acclaimed
piece and it is used as a source of reference for research in the
field of education by Muslims and Western academics alike
(Syamsyuddin, 2012). In the Islamic educational institutions,
particularly, the pesantren, the traditional Islamic boarding
schools in Indonesia, Ta`lm al-Muta`allim is often regarded
as the book of basic learning guidelines for students (Nata,
2003). It is a unique piece of work because its principles
explain the ethical foundation of teaching and learning. The
13 chapters of this discussion include issues relating to the
nature and merit of knowledge, the intention at the time of
the study, the types of knowledge permissible to acquire, and
respect for knowledge and those who possesses it. Others
include hard work and perseverance in the learning process,
when to start and organize the lesson, and tawakkul (trust in
God). He also discusses the time for the acquisition of knowl-
edge as well as time management in the teaching and learn-
ing process. Other topics include how to cooperate with and
show compassion to others in the learning process, issues
relating to self-discipline during the time of learning, how to
improve one's retentive memory and overcome forgetful-
ness, and how to survive materially during the period of
learning.
It could be argued that this treatise served a good purpose
for students. This is because, it appears, many students at that
time encountered certain difficulties in education and the
acquisition of quality knowledge; hence, they failed to
achieve their aims. According to al-Zarnj (2008), most of
these students did not successfully meet their goals because
they were not mindful of the correct methods of learning.
Thus, as Von Grunebaum and Abel (1947) conclude,
al-Zarnj's discourse facilitated the devising of a better
study approach or method to guide these students about
whom he had read and heard from his own teachers. In other
words, he believed that the students had not been taught what
was most beneficial for them and had, therefore, wasted the
chunk of their time on unbeneficial knowledge.
The Purpose of Learning in Islam
In appreciating the purpose of learning in Islam, it is essen-
tial to first understand the concept of education and its roots
in Islam. Three words denote education in Arabic. These
are ta`lm (which means, schooling, teaching, or instruc-
tion), tarbiyyah (which means, breeding, upbringing, or
nurturing), and ma`rifah (which basically means, knowl-
edge or know-how about something, learning, awareness
about a piece of information, etc.). Although the above
words, apparently, refer to different aspects of human
awareness, all of them revolve around the concept of edu-
cation. Quality education facilitates the expansion of one's
knowledge and the development of good manners (Halstead,
2004). Thus, there is a significant overlap between the three
words. At the core of the Islamic concept of education are
the principles that demand the production of graduates with
good morals, understanding of the Islamic codes of con-
duct, and commitment to the belief in God (tawhd). In
Islam, education is oriented to the tenets of the religion,
which uphold the belief in God. The assumption is that,
from the perspective of Islam, what is moral is religious;
Huda et al. 3
and so morality serves as the foundation of all processes
including education, which is the process of creating and
nurturing the human personality to absorb what is good.
However, secular ethicists argue that although it is impos-
sible to be religious without morality, it is possible to pro-
mote morality without religion (Halstead, 2004; McKay &
Whitehouse, 2015; Pyysiäinen & Hauser, 2010). Their
argument is that what is morally good does not necessarily
imply or score a religious value and vice versa. By this
understanding of morality or ethics, therefore, what is valu-
able in the sight of religious people does not necessarily
appear as ethical or moral on its own. Here, morality and
ethics are used interchangeably because what is morally
right is considered as ethical (Borhan, 1999; Yusuf, 2010).
Nonetheless, in Islam, morality or ethics is always deter-
mined by religious values and what is religiously com-
manded invariably becomes a moral obligation. Therefore,
the presence of morality is essential in Islamic education,
which is to nurture morally inclined learned men and
women to contribute to society's development.
Whatever form it takes, education is expected to pre-
pare the students to work toward the achievement of cer-
tain goals in life. Based on this principle, therefore, every
level of education should have a purpose for the student
and this has to be oriented to the well-being of both the
individual and the larger society. The specific purpose set
for any particular aspect of education is crucial for (a)
assessing the benefit of that aspect for the society and (b)
measuring the quality of the teaching process. Quality
teaching prepares the students to face future challenges
and serves as the basic requirement for achieving societal
goals. Hence, the purpose set for any field of education
determines how dynamic the graduates that would be pro-
duced would be. This implies that the teachers themselves
have to be dynamic at any material moment to facilitate the
setting up of a good standard for the transformation of
human life in its entirety. In this regard, it is the methods
that are capable of aiding the achievement of the educa-
tional purpose that will be used in the teaching and learn-
ing process at each level. In other words, the implementation
of the entire principles of education and the formulation of
teaching and learning methods are guided by the set pur-
pose. This is because all efforts would be focused on the
purpose. In setting the purpose for any field of study, three
core issues must be borne in mind. These are the target
population or the caliber of people it is designed for (i.e.,
its objective for the human society), the accessible or pro-
jected societal needs (i.e., present, growing, and future
demands in the society). This is the consideration of the
essential human needs and demands in the society
(Marimba, 1989). The other is the implication of this field
for the Islamic way of life (Marimba, 1989). The above are
required in setting a quality purpose in education from the
Islamic perspective.
Quality education has a clear purpose that applies to both
the learner and the educator (the teacher), and each of these
knows his own rights and responsibilities (Jonassen &
Grabowski, 2012). It is important to emphasize that educa-
tion is a cooperative process in which individuals study
together to achieve a purpose and equip themselves with the
methods for solving problems. Therefore, the best system of
education is basically built on problem-based learning. The
aim of education, and, indeed, the standard by which educa-
tional success is measured, is the transformation of the indi-
vidual through the development of both the moral and the
rational selves. In Islam, therefore, the ideal education does
not only focus on good character-building (attitude) and spir-
ituality but it is also expected to create a worthwhile purpose
or vision for the student. Thus, the curriculum has to be prac-
tical. The assumption is that, in today's world, human perfec-
tion cannot be achieved with religious knowledge alone.
Therefore, its integration with the practical sciences reflects
the overall essence of knowledge in Islam, which accelerates
transformation in terms of spirituality, character, and mate-
rial well-being and survival (al-Zarnj, 2008).
The purpose of the Islamic educational curriculum is to
design topics that will equip the students with a competent
technical know-how while sustaining their spirituality and
religious identity (al-Abrasy, 1975). However, the objective
of the spiritual or religious aspects is to increase the student's
awareness about his baser-self to transform him into the ideal
person the Islamic society expects. This is the main priority
of education from the Islamic point of view. In Islam, human
welfare comprises spiritual and physical aspects. Thus,
al-Zarnj argues that an individual who endeavors to learn
must first set the following general purposes for himself to
succeed. To
1.
Acquire knowledge about God and issues about the creation
of humankind
2. Make oneself pleasing to Allah
3. Facilitate one's happiness here and in the hereafter
4. Overcome one's own ignorance as well as that of others
5.
Live a religious life and maintain the Islamic religious
tenets in one's life
6.
Improve one's cognition (`aql) to better oneself in the
society. (Al-Zarnj, 2008)
From the above, the student's purposes could be classified
into three main categories. These are the purposes that relate
to the issues of `ibdah, the ultimate purpose of education in
Islam. The rest are the purposes that relate to interpersonal or
social (mu`malt) matters and the purposes set for the indi-
vidual's material development (Huda & Kartanegara, 2015a).
However, from al-Zarnj's perspective, the combination of
the above purposes, namely, the religious, the social, and the
individual's development-motivated purposes, determine
how successful the entire teaching and learning process
4 SAGE Open
would be. This implies that, in education, the setting of the
right purpose is a basic necessity. It is undeniable that social
and individual developments are major goals of education
today. Therefore, the same variables are expected to influ-
ence the purpose set by both the teacher and the student in all
the teaching and learning processes in order that the ethical
aspects will remain intact.
Ethical Considerations in the Learning
Process
The Islamic ethics on learning emphasize the responsibility
of the students to their teacher in the course of the study.
These ethics, therefore, emphasize that the students must
accord the teacher, and generally, all those who possess
knowledge, a maximum respect. Besides the above, what
the students learn also has ethical implications. According
to al-Zarnj, in designing a curriculum, the purpose as well
as the ethical aspects (i.e., its religious implications) should
be carefully considered to ensure that they are in harmony
with the principles of Islam. He argues that not all fields of
knowledge are ethical for consideration in education from
the Islamic perspective. Among the ethical fields are medi-
cal science and, of course, Islamic jurisprudence. These are
the fields of knowledge that are useful for the society.
However, in selecting the beneficial types of knowledge,
the availability of experienced or qualified teachers for
those fields is also an important prerequisite. In the third
chapter of his Ta`lim al-Muta`allim, al-Zarnj illustrates
the key points that enable students to determine which
fields are ethical and which are not. Students have to think
carefully before they choose disciplines in the course of
learning. Besides the general purposes enumerated earlier,
al-Zarnj also suggests that students select fields of learn-
ing in accordance with the specific purpose or goals they
have set for themselves in life. This implies that the parents'
choices for their wards do not find favor here because the
student's personal interest is very crucial in the choice of an
educational career. Even so, he also argues that a field like
astronomy is good for the Muslim students on condition
that one learns only what is helpful for determining the
times and direction (qiblah) of worship. Thus, here too, he
opines that the most recommended fields are those that
have a bearing on one's spiritual development (al-Zarnj,
2008).
In terms of the quality learning dynamics, however, the
above features help to identify the fields that are relevant for
achieving the student's purpose or goal while synchronizing
that purpose with the Islamic values. For example, if a stu-
dent purports to become an engineer, ethically, one must find
out whether engineering is consistent with Islamic values. If
they are found to be compatible, then, as mathematics (M)
and science (S) are basic to engineering, in addition to the
Islamic values, the student must be encouraged to study
M&S as requirements for achieving the purpose of becoming
an engineer. This helps to nurture potentials without hurting
the Islamic values (Paramboor & Ibrahim, 2014).
In connection with the ethical issues in teaching and
learning, al-Zarnj identifies three types of human beings.
1. The first category covers the virtuous person who
always not only expresses a good opinion, but also
interacts with and consults virtuous and intelligent
people. A person with good intellectual potentials
offers good advice or counseling to his fellows and
almost always transforms his followers into people of
fine morals, wisdom, and tolerance. Therefore, if this
person were to be a teacher, through his good super-
vision, guidance, and counseling, his students would
interact better and engage with his instructions
(Roorda, Koomen, Spilt, & Oort, 2011).
2. The second category is lower than the first one. This
person has no correct opinion about anything.
Nonetheless, he makes effort to consult others who
might know to update him. As it has been indicated,
he has no proper opinion of his own. However, a stu-
dent who always has his own opinion about issues is
more inclined to learn to be analytic, looks at issues
critically, and attempts to recognize and solve prob-
lems in a creative way. The one with a weak opinion
about things is often close-minded because he learns
only by listening to others. This type of person often
turns out to be conservative and uncreative in the way
he perceives things. He always emphasizes the neces-
sity for precedence and opens up to ideas but only to
the extent that others have affirmed or recognized
them through their own reasoning (Paramboor &
Ibrahim, 2014).
3. However, the third category is the one who neither
possesses any correct opinion about anything nor
consults or seeks information from others. This is a
sign of arrogance (takabbur) in the learning process.
Such a person often boasts about any little knowl-
edge he happens to possess. It is about this person
that the Arabs have a proverb: Man qla l adr wa
huwa yata`allam afd
.alu miman yadr wa huwa
yata`zzam (which means, "He who says `I do not
know' and learns is better than him who knows but
puffs himself up"). The implication of the above is
that there should be a conscious effort to always learn
from others even if one is in the know. Furthermore,
it is better to search for knowledge and information
from those with experience in a given subject and
location. This gives us a lead into the view that much
of what one acquires is through listening; and this
could be from within or outside the formal instruc-
tional environment. Thus, he who does not know is to
update himself from his own colleagues or precursors
who have the expertise and experience. In addition,
one is to remain open-minded and be willing to share
Huda et al. 5
with others. This implies that an educational environ-
ment populated by virtuous and intelligent students
or scholars is likely to produce virtuous and open-
minded scholars and vice versa.
People who are inclined to share and receive from others
increase their knowledge more than those who stay on the
islands of their own wisdom. This is because teaching not
only imparts knowledge, but it also improves a person's wis-
dom and increases his awareness. That is why the prophet is
reported to have said that the best (the most virtuous) among
humankind are those who learn and teach it to others.
Although, regarding this, he was particularly referring to the
teaching and learning of the Qur'an, the pivot of Islamic
knowledge. Nonetheless, consistent with al-Zarnj, the
Islamic knowledge, for which the Qur'an serves as the focal
point of reference, transcends beyond mere spiritual (naqli)
knowledge to rational (`aqli) knowledge like medical sci-
ence, and so forth, as well. It could be argued that Muslim
professionals like medical doctors and engineers who are
also well-educated religiously or morally set for themselves
better goals in life, which are often consistent with the
Islamic belief in God.
Due to the significant role ethics plays in the Islamic
teaching and learning process, al-Zarnj proposes that
teachers should focus more on the moral challenges in the
society (al-Zarnj, 2008). In contemporary times, when stu-
dents are expected to aim toward specific goals, the technical
know-how to facilitate the achievement of those goals
becomes the main focus of attention in the teaching process
(Elliott, 2015). A student who has high aspirations requires
dedication to achieve his goals. Nonetheless, from the
Islamic perspective, nothing could be properly accomplished
without religious values or divine intervention. This is why
the learning process moves conterminously with the reli-
gious ethics. Al-Zarnj points out that in building students'
intellectual capabilities, the system should take into account
the ethical issues bordering on human relationship such as
respect, humility, and obedience. These issues are crucial to
successful learning even in modern times.
From the foregoing discussion, it has become clear that,
in Islam, morality plays a vital role in shaping student's
future aspirations. This makes the learning a mechanical pro-
cess of facilitating the student's moral and rational transfor-
mation through the application of specific principles. For
that reason, the programs ought to be relevant to the student's
goals as well as those of the society. In this vein, the studied
programs are expected to move hand-in-hand with the needs
of the larger society. This is to enable the graduates to use
their expertise to contribute toward the achievement of soci-
etal goals in the long run. That is necessary because the soci-
ety is the ultimate target of the entire education system.
However, it appears that the issue of how to design quality
programs that back students' purposes in life while helping
society to achieve its goals remains a major challenge of
education at all levels today. Yet, addressing this challenge is
crucial in helping students to properly engage with the core
elements of learning in a comprehensive way.
Toward a Comprehensive Learning
Process
Generally, learning (ta`lm) can be conceived as the process
of acquiring knowledge. Therefore, its main features are crit-
ical thinking and pragmatic problem-solving skills
(Weinstein, 2012). The urge to learn can be active in a person
throughout his lifetime. This is because it is a human instinct.
Despite this, the understanding of what happens in a person's
immediate surroundings is part and parcel of the individual's
thinking skills, and this increases during the period of learn-
ing in school. One's physical experience in a particular envi-
ronment influences one's intellectual behavior, sense of
judgment, and ability to solve problems. Thus, an individual
who studies in an educational environment where ethical
standards are very low is likely to have a different under-
standing of what is right or wrong in the larger society. A
comprehensive teaching that imparts to students virtues in
combination with critical thinking and problem-solving
skills produces individuals who serve the society better. In
ensuring that students' behavior and character are shaped
within the learning environment, it is important to design the
principle for regulating their interactions. These principles
grant the teachers the opportunity to assess the students'
problem-solving capabilities through observation, for exam-
ple, during extracurricular activities. Educational principles
are often designed using alternative strategies such as peer
review and institutional networking, all of which play sig-
nificant roles in enhancing the quality of teaching and learn-
ing (Elliott, 2015). When teachers show active interest in
students'moral well-being both in and outside the classroom,
they create the atmosphere for the students to support each
other to learn these moral values. Thus, from the Islamic per-
spective, a comprehensive learning takes place within an
education system in which the essential guidelines for teach-
ing and learning are guided by these tenets.
For this reason, al-Zarnj posits that the teaching and
learning process has some core features (al-Zarnj, 2008).
The teacher transfers knowledge through lectures on a sub-
ject to the student. The student is then expected to preserve it
by not only listening but also writing, carefully observing,
behaving calmly, and trusting in God (tawakkul). Indeed,
these features are very important and manifest in the teach-
ing and learning process at all levels. Learning also involves
the acquisition of skills (be it for reasoning or for solving
problems), transformation of human behavior, and the man-
agement of personal preferences (Jonassen & Grabowski,
2012). It, therefore, aims toward the development of the per-
son in totality (Brophy, 2013). However, the learning ability
develops in stages. Therefore, the quality of the conditions,
both within and outside the classroom, is fundamental to the
6 SAGE Open
holistic or comprehensive learning process because it
enhances the students' gradual self-awareness and in-depth
appreciation of the processes of life.
Requirements of Comprehensive
Learning
The theory of learning is largely based on the fundamental
assumption that the student is at the center of the teaching
and learning process (Slade & Prinsloo, 2013). For this
reason, any attempt to improve the problem-solving exper-
tise of students must include educational principles that
incorporate various skills or subjects. While the skills for
resolving complex problems are major components of edu-
cation programs, these skills require customized learning.
It is from this perspective that al-Zarnj argues that, if the
training and development programs target the students'
mind and spiritual self, the students will be prepared to
face all challenges. Thus, among such training and devel-
opment programs is what will aim at both the physical
transformation and the building of the soul (al-Zarnj,
2008). The contextual meaning of "building the soul" is
spiritual self-discipline or continence, which is central to
hard work within the social context. However, self-disci-
pline or continence also implies forbearance in carrying
out duties in the learning process. This demands careful
planning, observation, and evaluation, all of which require
creativity and self-control (Zimmerman, 2008). It is impor-
tant to note that if students are guided in the learning pro-
cess by experienced teachers, they show creativity in their
way of thinking and doing things.As the teacher is expected
to guide the students in a learning process in which both
the ethical and technical aspects shall move hand-in-hand,
the teacher becomes an all-inclusive or comprehensive
educator, the moral educator (murabb) of Hussein Nasr
(1987). This is because the above conglomerates will ulti-
mately lead to comprehensive education that will promote
self-criticism or introspection, self-discipline, self-motiva-
tion, and willingness toward self-responsibility. This will,
in turn, encourage the student's self-reliance, self-assur-
ance, independent thinking, and spiritual fortitude that will
eventually make him the perfect man (insn al-kmil) in
the Muslim society.
In addition to the above coordinates that will help to bring
about comprehensive education from the Islamic educational
perspective, many other variables are needed to sustain it.
The provision of sustainable support for achieving results-
oriented education is a necessity for modern life. This is due
to the significant role education plays in developing and
nourishing people's potentials for continuous societal
growth. That suggests that to facilitate a comprehensive
learning, all important stakeholders of an educational institu-
tion must discharge their duties as required. In examining
comprehensive learning, al-Zarnj outlines six important
requirements. These include holistic intelligence or capabil-
ity for learning, motivation for learning, patience and com-
mitment to the learning process, affordability and financial
support, teacher's inspiration and determination, and com-
mitment to time management in learning. As the above are
crucial for the comprehensive education, we shall examine
them below.
Holistic Intelligence or Capability for Learning
Al-Zarnj points out that the first requirement for learning is
intelligence. This requirement weighs more on the side of the
student than the teacher although, as a matter of fact, it is a
requirement for the teacher as well. Intelligence here is the
ability to understand the relationships between issues through
the process of mental abstraction and sensitization of data
that create new methods for solving difficult problems
(Chiappe & MacDonald, 2005). This becomes an important
motivation for learning in the first place because it reduces
pressure on the brain. An intelligent student solves research
problems easily without stress and this encourages him to
learn more. This suggests that intelligence, as the capacity to
acquire and apply knowledge, accelerates the performance of
the intellect and the ability to reason, which, in every practi-
cal sense, bears the logic of education at all its levels today.
Naturally, a high level of intelligence enables people to think,
understand, and properly reason about what they see or per-
ceive. Beyond that, intelligence also helps one to practically
transform a piece of idea into tangible product or use this
idea to formulate new theories. The intellect at this level is
the developed form that tries to contextualize ideas to gener-
ate new ones for improving one's well-being (Bråten &
Strømsø, 2004). Given that every human being possesses a
different level of intelligence, the ability to understand infor-
mation or interpret data also varies significantly. This
explains why students perform differently at the same level
of education. Thus, as it has been indicated in al-Zarnj's
Ta`lm al-Muta`allim, intelligence is significant in the learn-
ing process because it helps the students to interact with
ideas.
Intelligence determines a person's ability to learn. This is
because it describes the human ability to skillfully use reason
to understand ideas in a variety of situations and to apply this
knowledge in different circumstances of life. The cognitive
process has many aspects. These include, among others, mem-
orizing, logical thinking, creativity, and problem-solving tech-
niques (Sternberg & Grigorenko, 2004). Indeed, al-Zarnj
emphasizes that a successful learning requires the effective-
ness of all the aspects of one's cognition. Thus, in the context
of applied behavioral knowledge, particularly clinical psy-
chology, the human intellect has been one of the most widely
researched topics. High level of intelligence implies fully
developed cognitive ability and these, together, determine the
success of the comprehensive learning process.

Motivation for Learning
In education, the motivation to learn plays an important role
in encouraging the student. This requirement is of primary
importance or, perhaps, even more important than the first
one. This is because an intelligent person who finds himself
in a school but does not have the slightest motivation to learn
any particular field of study is like a round peg put in a square
hole. The flair for learning, which al-Zarnj refers to as
motivation, arises from the combination of conscious, sub-
conscious, and unconscious factors. These are the intensity
of the student's desire or need, moral incentive or the value
of the expected outcome, and personal expectations. These
factors also serve as the background for the achievement of
goals. For example, a student expends extra energy in study-
ing for a test because he or she wants a good grade. Here, the
desire for a good grade, which ultimately serves as the
benchmark for getting a good job after school, motivates him
to learn more although he might not be so intelligent. Thus,
motivation is very important for learning. In the conscious
attempt to acquire a particular skill, therefore, motivation
becomes a major consideration. For the teachers, however,
dedication and self-sacrifice are major motivations (Huda &
Kartanegara, 2015c) although there are many others.
Motivation enables the individuals to pursue their goals
with enthusiasm and conscious effort. Consciousness
increases one's learning potentials and ability to grasp ideas
(Schutte et al., 1998). It facilitates personal concentration,
which in turn enables a student to perform well in class.
Therefore, motivation has a substantial impact on the emo-
tional well-being of students and this manifests in the out-
comes either positively or negatively (Runco, 2005). It
reflects in the performance of students in a wide range of
activities. In short, motivation affects all the personal deci-
sions of a learner. It plays a leading role in enhancing the
desire that backs the achievement of goals. As it has already
been implied, it enables students to accomplish a task with an
engrossing interest. This is, irrespective of whether it is easy
or difficult, because motivation not only increases their
desires but it also maintains their enthusiasm and resilience
(Boekaerts, 2002).
Al-Zarnj also posits that students are also motivated if
the teacher pays maximum attention to their opinions, judg-
ments, and values and appreciates their efforts and perfor-
mance in the learning process. This is a good motivation
because human beings are naturally more disposed to do bet-
ter when praised than when criticized; therefore, at the ele-
mentary levels of learning, this should be taken seriously.
Patience and Emotional Commitment to Learning
Patience is a stable state of mind that enables a person to toler-
ate either delays in the fulfillment of personal goals or, particu-
larly, the prolongation of suffering without anxiety. In Islam,
patience (sabr) is viewed as an important human quality. It
concerns the ability to persevere in time of inconveniences and
the subconscious effort to trust in God for the right time. In
this case, one could argue that the Islamic concept of patience
has a close affinity to the trust in God (tawakkul) which is
within the ambit of the development of the soul. The soul
remains active even in the face of severe challenges.
Nonetheless, the human physical ability to resist these chal-
lenges is always a problem in the mundane existence.
Generally, patience has two main dimensions (Shihab, 2007).
These are
1. The physical (external) dimension: This denotes the
ability to relax or persevere, for example, in the dis-
charge of one's religious duties such as prayers, hajj,
and so forth. It is obvious that impatience could affect
the quality of one's prayers, whether in a congrega-
tion or not. Whoever is in a hurry does not pray prop-
erly. This category also includes fortitude in times of
suffering and both natural and unnatural delays in the
fulfillment of personal goals.
2. The mental (internal) dimension: This includes the
ability to control one's desires in such a way that
one's behavior will be free from shameful character-
istics or emotional conditions such as excessive
anger, quick temper, and so forth.
Consistent with al-Zarnj's discourse, both categories above
are important for the student. A quick-tempered student is
likely to encounter challenges not only in relating with his
colleagues but, as well, his own teacher when he is rebuked.
However, learning could be very frustrating at certain stages
of one's life and requires patience and perseverance to suc-
ceed. This is the basis of the Arabic proverb which reads,
al-najh `qibah al-ladhna yajtahidn [which literally
means, "success is the reward of those who work hard (per-
severe)"]. Hence, in the process of education, it is necessary
for students to be patient in all its categories. For al-Zarnj
(2008), being patient and steadfast is at the root of all suc-
cess. Nonetheless, he also argues that rarely are there people
who can be patient in all things. This is in line with the axiom
that "everything is surely intended to a certain level, even the
highest, but it is rare for anyone to keep up in achieving what
is intended" (Turfe, 1996, p. 29). The implication is that
patience is a major determinant of success in all aspects of
human life.
Closely associated with the issue of patience and perse-
verance is what one could refer to as "the staying power."
Al-Zarnj puts forward some essential principles for
enabling students to stay put and continue to exert mental
power during the periods of learning. These include the
following.
1. It is essential that students always learn under the
guide of a teacher. Normally, when people learn by
listening, they relax, tolerate, and capture ideas faster
8 SAGE Open
than when they read on their own. Therefore, for
al-Zarnj, students should learn mainly by listening
to the teacher during the instructional hours. It
appears that, due to the rigorous nature of the educa-
tion delivery at the higher level, where students are
encouraged to do independent research, this principle
might be more relevant to younger learners. Yet, it
should be noted that even at the higher levels, stu-
dents patiently listen to lectures delivered by their
teachers. Even among terminal research students,
there are directed-reading and thinking (Valeri-Gold,
1987) and consultation for thesis research. All these
require students' patience in waiting and listening to
the teacher known by different titles at each of the
levels (e.g., teacher, tutor, lecturer, supervisor, or
mentor). The contemporary university students face
the challenge of access to low-quality information
due to the upsurge of Internet resources. With the
advent of the worldwide web, the present university
students have more access to information than any
other generation of learners. Regrettably, however,
much of this information is prejudiced, faulty, or
even incorrect (El-Koumy, 2006). Many individuals
promulgate mischievous information on the Internet
due to either ignorance or ill motive. This requires
students to exert extra mental effort to synchronize
their own thoughts with the information they read to
think beyond or outside the information box. In an
era of human insecurity (Yusuf, 2014) caused mainly
by misconstrued religious beliefs and values, higher
research students'access to information is of primary
concern in higher Islamic educational institutions.
Therefore, the teachers' directing of reading and
research at all levels is very important.
2. A student is not supposed to leave a book until he has
completely grasped the content at any material
moment. This brings in the issue of perseverance.
The human mind captures ideas in stages. Hence,
when one is learning for a purpose, putting the learn-
ing material or the book down when one has not fully
captured its salient ideas is discouraged by al-Zarnj.
The implication is that one should attempt to study
only when one has adequate time for the learning.
Once one begins to learn, one must continue until one
has fully comprehended the lesson.
3. A student should not leave a subject for another with-
out having clearly understood the first one. This is,
particularly, important in one's private studies out-
side the instructional hours. During this period,
switching between subjects is not the ideal.
4. A student should not vacate the learning environment
when specific lessons on a certain subject are in ses-
sion unless one is forced by necessity (darrah).
When one leaves a class while a lesson is in progress,
it will take one some moments, when one returns, to
adjust to the pace of learning with one's colleagues.
Therefore, it is in the student's interest to wait for the
teacher to conclude the lesson before deciding to
leave.
As a skill in learning, patience is a virtue that enables stu-
dents to endure in the course of their studies. Thus, persever-
ance and patience are crucial to learning. On the teacher's
own side, patience is significant for tolerating the eccentric
behavior of students and ensuring their academic success.
Affordability and Financial Support
Financial support is a major challenge in the quest for
knowledge whether at the formal or the non-formal levels.
It is an important ingredient for achieving one's purpose in
education. A sound financial standing helps the student in
the payment of fees and eases the suffering caused by the
cost of living during the learning period. This is because
students are not to depend on others for their sustenance
(al-Zarnj, 2008). Supriyadi (2006) identifies a few
expenditures in educational institutions. These, among
others, include tuition fees and the cost of the physical
facilities like books, the learning materials. The extent to
which funds are available for managing the above has
implications for the performance of the student. A student
who has a reliable source of funding is better motivated to
perform well in school.
However, this financial support also does not concern
the student alone but the learning environment itself as well
as the teachers. It is a fact that the instructors themselves
are better motivated to give out their best if they are sup-
ported through the provision of Teaching and Learning
Materials (TLMs) necessary for at least the teaching pro-
cess. When the necessary resources for both teaching and
learning are provided, then we can expect quality education
that reflects the commitment of the parties to bring about
quality educational results. In creating an atmosphere for
quality education delivery, therefore, funding is very impor-
tant (Carnoy, 2000). Partnership can play a crucial role in
sustaining quality education. This reduces the expenditure
students may have to incur while supporting learners with
limited or inadequate financial resources (Pouncey, Ennis,
Woolley, & Connell, 2013). This happens if a chunk of the
educational expenses are borne by the state although that
also comes with its own challenge. The separation of edu-
cational institutions from state funding affects the quality
of education and, consequently, students' enrollment and
opportunities. The success of educational institutions
largely depends on the availability of financial support (V.
M. Robinson, 2007). This implies that the issue of funding
is an important factor in the learning process be it on the
side of the student or the teacher and whether at the lower
or higher levels. This makes al-Zarnj's perspective in this
regard very relevant today.
Huda et al. 9
The Teacher's Inspiration
The role of teachers in inspiring students cannot be underes-
timated in the learning process. In the course of instruction, a
student is expected to be inspired by the teacher. This inspi-
ration increases the student's emotional attachment to the
learning process. The teacher's way of instructing must sup-
port the cognitive development of the student. As a moral
agent in the learning environment, the teacher is an exemplar
whom the students would try to follow. Hence, this inspira-
tion is essential. Al-Zarnj identifies three types of teachers.
These are
1. Shaykh al-ta'lm: This refers to a teacher who merely
imparts knowledge. He might or might not be inter-
ested in the students' moral well-being (akhlq). The
interest of this teacher is to improve the cognitive or
mental ability (`aql) of the student.
2. Shaykh al-tarbiyyah: This is the teacher who, in addi-
tion to transforming the mind of the student, also
concerns himself with the student's moral
well-being.
3. Shaykh al-tarqiyyah: This is the teacher whose
method of teaching transforms the student's way of
thinking (cognition), moral as well as the spiritual
well-being. This is the S
.f-teacher who is superior to
the first two.
This means that, as a role model, the teacher must have a noble
personality that is worthy of emulation and respect. Students
often observe the behavior and attitude of their teachers not
only during the teaching and learning process in the class-
room, but also, outside the learning environment. That being
the case, the teacher's role in inspiring the students with noble
values must manifest both within the school and outside it. A
noble teacher possesses good character traits that influence his
students to admire him (Osguthorpe, 2015). For al-Zarnj, the
quality of education also depends on the ability of teachers to
perform this key role in the process of teaching. Furthermore,
a good relationship between the student and the teacher is cru-
cial for enabling this inspiration and the striving for excellence
through guidance. However, achieving such a relationship
requires that the student respects the teacher. This will create
the enabling opportunity for the teacher to give out his best in
sincere and dedicated manner through combined physical,
mental, and spiritual efforts. This will eventually bring the
teacher to the third category above.
Students are able to perform better under teachers who
understand their weaknesses and show them love through
professional guidance in class. However, a good relationship
between the parents and the teachers is also very important in
maintaining respect between the teacher and his student.
Whatever the case, as the teacher is an inspirer or a model for
the students, al-Zarnj (2008) maintains that it is necessary
for him to always stay away from reprehensible ways of life.
Time Management in Learning
Time management here refers to (a) the right time to learn
and (b) how each period is utilized by both the teacher and
the student during the learning process. The first refers to the
time during which learning is most preferred. On the other
hand, the second refers to the process of planning and orga-
nizing the day into periods to make judicious use of time for
specific activities and increase productivity (Adair, 2009).
Al-Zarnj maintains that learning requires careful manage-
ment of time. To achieve good results, both the teacher and
the student have to be cautious about time. The proper man-
agement of time also has an impact on students'performance
(Biggers, 1980; Dunn, 1985; Hartley & Nicholls, 2008;
Klein, 2001; Wile & Shouppe, 2011). It is an undeniable fact
that students perform better when certain subjects are taught
during specific periods of the day (Klein, 2001). For exam-
ple, the memorization (h
.ifz
.) of the Qur'n is better fit for the
early morning. This is because, apart from the spiritual ben-
efits, according to a research by Millar, Styles, and Wastell
(1980), morning learning has a superior immediate recall
than learning in the afternoon or evening although Wile and
Shouppe also argue that "material initially learned in [the]
afternoon is more beneficial to long-term memory recall"
(p. 21). Anyone who memorizes will surely forget something
at some point. For this reason, although al-Zarnj argues
that listening to the teacher makes the learning easier, he fur-
ther stresses that through writing, students will be able to
retain much of what they listen to from their teacher. This
perspective of al-Zarnj explains the two main modes of
learning, namely, learning by listening and learning by writ-
ing. As it has already been stressed, the former is the easiest
mode of learning. However, it requires a strong retentive
memory. On the contrary, the latter is the more difficult
because it also involves listening, in addition to writing,
reading, and memorizing. In other words, after one has lis-
tened to the instruction and committed it to writing, one has
to re-read later and memorize it. Nonetheless, al-Zarnj
places much emphasis on writing (after listening) as the best
mode of learning because it is the most effective type for
students with weak and retentive memories alike. This is
because everyone can refresh his memory from what he
wrote down earlier in the event of forgetfulness, which is a
likely consequence of memorization. Furthermore, mathe-
matics is probably better grasped when it is taught in the
morning than in the afternoon depending on other factors
(Klein, 2001; Pope, 2016; Wile & Shouppe, 2011). However,
people pick a language faster when they begin to learn it
when they are young, preferably before the age of puberty
(Johnstone, 2002). This confirms the view by Penfield and
Roberts (1959) and Lenneberg (1967) who argued that as
children mature, certain changes in the brain gradually ren-
der it incapable of absorbing languages unconsciously as it
occurs in the formative years. From the above, it is clear that
not teaching or learning at the right time invariably affects
10 SAGE Open
the quality of the outcome. Therefore, the prioritization of
activities is a necessity in time management and it helps to
synchronize the most important activities with the available
time space (Schutte et al., 1998). This suggests that specific
time management strategies have to be devised. Generally, a
well-structured educational institution has a department
(e.g., timetable planning committee) for helping both teach-
ers and students to manage time wisely.
In spite of that, the effectiveness of time management also
depends on some other personal factors. The success in the
management of one's time varies largely according to indi-
vidual abilities and responsibilities (Priem & Butler, 2001).
There are many ways by which time could be managed effec-
tively for good learning results. One is to make an up-to-date
record of all important personal activities in order of priority
so that the most important ones come first. This is then fol-
lowed by the allocation of specific periods for each of these
activities bearing in mind the effort one will have to put in
each of those activities as well as the goal set for every par-
ticular activity.
Some Important Reflections
From the foregoing discussion, it could be realized that
al-Zarnj's discourse on quality learning contains important
principles that could be useful for improving the perfor-
mance of students and teachers today. The principles of his
book, Ta`lim al-Muta`allim, could address important practi-
cal shortfalls in the present implementation of educational
policies. The essential theme that applies to virtually all edu-
cation systems is the production of good and well-informed
personalities whose knowledge will not only be relevant but,
as well, transform the society and maintain moral values.
From the Islamic perspective, these moral values include
what, from the point of view of the Qur'an and the prophetic
sunnan, is capable of ensuring peace and tranquility at all
levels of the society. For al-Zarnji, therefore, Islam under-
stands education or learning as an all-inclusive phenomenon
that covers all aspects of human development, be it rational,
spiritual, or emotional. Therefore, all these must be achieved
by the student at the end of his training. From al-Zarnj's
standpoint, anything less than the above defeats the purpose
of education. The aim of Islamic education is to produce
graduates with values to facilitate successful life here and in
the hereafter. To achieve this aim without compromising the
scientific or rational knowledge that is needed for the soci-
ety's material well-being, these values are expected to be
merged with the scientific fields of knowledge. Islam views
this type of education as an obligation (fard
.) and it could be
incumbent on the individual alone (fard
.u `ayn) or the society
as a whole (fard
.u kifyah). For this and other reasons, the
quest for knowledge is seen as a form of worship (`ibdah;
Grine, Bensaid, & Z. M. Yusoff, 2013).
It has also become clear that, despite the fact that educa-
tion is an obligation for all Muslims, there are specific
conditions or requirements that must be fulfilled before one
could seek knowledge or before learning could be success-
ful. Among these requirements, it appears that, although
motivation and, particularly, intellectual capability (Pintrich,
2003) are basic, financial support and affordability could be
considered as very essential for quality education. This is,
particularly, relevant in today's educational pursuit. Research
indicates that on the average, the measure of total expendi-
ture per-student is closely linked with better student out-
comes (Baker, 2012; Baker, Sciarra, & Farrie, 2012; Carey,
2002). It is obvious that the effect produced might be higher
in some fields of study than in others. The implication is that,
in some cases, additional financial support matters more for
some students than others. Nonetheless, there are many other
factors that could moderate the impact of funding on student
outcomes. These include, among other things, the student's
own manner of spending. When money is spent wisely, it
yields good outcomes for students. Also, TLMs, teacher
compensation, the recruitment and retention of a higher qual-
ity teacher workforce, all of which have financial implica-
tions, are closely linked with quality student outcomes
(Baker, 2012; Barnett, 2011). In spite of the necessity of
funding in education, the disposable funds in the hands of
individuals are always not enough at any material moment.
This necessitates the involvement of the state in the funding
of education at all levels. Research indicates that the continu-
ous improvements in funding in public schools has an impact
on student outcomes (Baker, 2012; Baker et al., 2012; Coley
& Baker, 2013; Turner, 1994). In addition, adequate provi-
sion of funds to schools provides the necessary conditions
for improving the quality of their results.
Nonetheless, the fulfillment of these requirements might
not guarantee the overall quality and ideal outcome until the
mechanisms for accountability for the utilization of educa-
tional funds are devised. Funds have to be properly invested
(Baker et al., 2012). This brings back the issues of purpose
and goal. It is required that the available resources are
directed to support key areas such as quality teaching, a good
curriculum that details the principal elements for guiding the
quality of teaching, and an effective program for financially
vulnerable students (ETS Policy Information Center, 2008).
The latter can be achieved through effective supervision and
monitoring. From the above, it is clear that, fundamentally,
the public funding of education is to ensure that
. . . all students have access to high quality educational
opportunities that prepare them to assume the responsibilities of
citizenship and to succeed in the economy [i.e., the society].
(Baker et al., 2012, p. 1; cf. Baker & Welner, 2011)
Although intelligence or intellectual capability is a sine qua
non for a successful academic journey, no matter how intel-
ligent a person can be, if the necessary funds to support this
intelligence are not available at the right time, the achieve-
ment of goals cannot materialize. Although it might differ
Huda et al. 11
from one student to the other, the ability to grasp complex
ideas and adapt them effectively to social and environmental
circumstance is nurtured through the reading of books, be
they published materials or self-written manuscripts. All
these come with financial cost to the student. Therefore,
being a good learner implies that one consistently associates
with these materials and engages in various forms of reason-
ing in the face of financial barriers. And this will invariably
affect the quality of the outcome. Wisdom acquired through
reading can be applied in solving everyday problems and for-
mulating strategies for bettering one's life. In this case, the
absence of these reading or learning materials due to poor
funding detracts a lot from the learning outcomes.
Another point of interest is the teacher's inspiration of the
student. Every teacher wishes to inspire his students to put up
their maximum in the course of teaching and even after-
wards. Yet, enhancing students' interest in the classroom and
encouraging them to achieve success have been a major chal-
lenge for teachers of all categories, including even the expe-
rienced ones. If the content is not relevant to the students'
expectations and goals (Malouff, Rooke, Schutte, Foster, &
Bhullar, 2008), it diffuses their motivation to learn.
Furthermore, a good student­teacher relationship is an essen-
tial tool for inspiring the student (Malouff et al., 2008). This
implies that a teacher who wishes to inspire his students must
first establish a cordial relationship with them and, in the
Islamic way, allow recommended ethics to guide this rela-
tionship. Children are much inspired or motivated by people
who make them feel safe, whether emotionally or physically,
whenever they are with them. In addition, the style of teach-
ing also goes a long way to inspire the students. A teacher
who uses an appealing style to teach is more likely to inspire
his students in the teaching process than those who use an
old-fashioned and careless approach. It is undeniable that
whenever a student is being examined, the teacher's perfor-
mance indirectly comes to light. Therefore, quality student
outcomes reflect the competence of the teacher. This means
that, while motivation, be it emotional or in the form of fund-
ing, facilitates good outcomes, the teacher's expertise in
supervising and guiding is also very important. A teacher's
poor performance is not difficult to tell (T. E. Robinson &
Hope, 2013; Ward, 2001). According to Ward (2001), the
poor teacher tells but the good teacher clarifies or elucidates.
The one who is superior to these two teachers goes further to
practicalize the teaching by demonstrating. Yet, the greatest
teacher inspires (Ward, 2001). From the Islamic viewpoint,
the teacher who inspires is a moral educator and a standard
bearer or role model for the students. The assumption is that
the teacher who inspires is not only disposed to teach by first
informing, clarifying the information, and going further to
practicalize it by demonstrating, but he also prepares well to
instruct (T. E. Robinson & Hope, 2013) and sets the standard
for the students' behavior in its entirety.
In spite of the above, the issue of increasing awareness
about teachers' responsibilities in creating favorable
conditions in the classroom has conventionally not attracted
much attention in a myriad of teacher training programs.
Much interest is shown in workers' funding and motivation
(Prendergast, 2002; Van-Knippenberg, 2000), particularly, in
the field of teaching (Frase & Sorenson, 1992; Sargent &
Hannum, 2005). Yet, for several years, students' motivation
in the learning environment has continued to pose a chal-
lenge for all teachers, both the experienced and the less expe-
rienced (Malouff et al., 2008). To properly engage the minds
of students, teachers have to redefine their pedagogy to
include learning theories that encourage originality in think-
ing and allow students to have their own understanding of
the world through personal experiences and deep reflections
on those experiences (Runesson, 2015). Students learn
through their interaction with their teachers both in and out-
side the classroom, especially in the early stages of learning.
Nonetheless, to achieve fruitful outcomes, all the examined
requirements must be satisfied so that learning could be
all-inclusive.
Conclusion
This article examined the students' learning requirements
detailed in al-Zarnj's best-seller, Ta`lm al-Muta`allim. The
book expounds the principles for achieving quality education
and could be useful for improving the performance of both
students and teachers today. These principles address impor-
tant practical shortfalls in the present implementation of edu-
cational policies. The book details the requirements for
bringing about well-informed personalities whose knowl-
edge will be relevant for the transformation of the society
and the maintenance of moral values. In attempting to appre-
ciate these requirements, although the research is basically
library-based, it addresses several issues that affect students
and, to a large extent, teachers, in the teaching and learning
process. Al-Zarnj identifies six principal requirements that
could promote quality learning among students and, to some
extent, quality teaching among teachers. These include intel-
ligence and high learning ability; high motivation for learn-
ing; patience, emotional stability, and commitment to the
learning process; availability of financial support; availabil-
ity of inspiring teachers; and disposition to quality time man-
agement in the learning process. It is found that these
requirements are still relevant to the contemporary situa-
tions. It also came to light that much of what the student
grasps comes from his engagement with his teacher through
listening and observation both in and outside the classroom.
Therefore, it is undeniable that high cognitive or intellectual
ability is an important requirement for learning at all levels.
Nonetheless, it is argued that the quality of learning, whether
in the classroom or outside it, does not always depend on the
student's cognitive ability alone. Rather, it is also determined
by a multiple of motivational factors (Kubanyiova, 2006)
such us the desire for learning and funding. In addition,
favorable conditions within the classroom environment (e.g.,
12 SAGE Open
a good relationship between the student and the teacher) are
major motivations for students (Pintrich, Marx, & Boyle,
1993). These also have an impact on the learning outcomes
(Kubanyiova, 2006). Furthermore, teachers play a vital role
in creating the above favorable conditions and the motivat-
ing learning environment because they are expected to adopt
numerous positive measures (Brophy, 2004; D_
örnyei, 2001)
to inspire through demonstrative teaching.
