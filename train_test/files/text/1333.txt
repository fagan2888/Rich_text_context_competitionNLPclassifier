Among US adults with diabetes, using data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey for
1971­1974, 1976­1980, 1988­1994, and 1999­2000, the authors describe 30-year trends in total cholesterol,
blood pressure, and smoking levels. Using Bayesian models, the authors calculated mean changes per year and
95% credible intervals for age-adjusted mean total cholesterol and blood pressure levels and the prevalence of
high total cholesterol (5.17 mmol/liter), high blood pressure (systolic blood pressure: 140 mmHg and/or
diastolic blood pressure: 90 mmHg), and smoking. Between 1971­1974 and 1999­2000, mean total cholesterol
declined from 5.95 mmol/liter to 5.48 mmol/liter (­0.02 (95% credible interval: ­0.03, ­0.01) mmol/liter per year).
The proportion with high cholesterol decreased from 72% to 55%. Mean blood pressure declined from 146/86
mmHg to 134/72 mmHg (systolic blood pressure: ­0.5 (95% credible interval: ­1.1, 0.5) mmHg per year; diastolic
blood pressure: ­0.6 (95% credible interval: ­1.0, ­0.03) mmHg per year). The proportion with high blood
pressure decreased from 64% to 37%, and smoking prevalence decreased from 32% to 17%. Although these
trends are encouraging, still one of two people with diabetes has high cholesterol, one of three has high blood
pressure, and one of six is a smoker.

Abbreviation: NHANES, National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey.
In most industrialized countries, mortality from heart
disease has declined over the past 30 years but remains the
leading cause of death (1, 2). Heart disease is also the most
frequent cause of death among persons with diabetes (3, 4).
A national study, however, found that heart disease mortality
among men declined 36 percent among those without
diabetes and only 13 percent among those who had diabetes
(5). For women without diabetes, there was a decline in heart
disease mortality of 27 percent, while for those with diabetes
a nonsignificant increase of 23 percent was reported (5).
In the general population, reductions in serum cholesterol,
blood pressure, and cigarette smoking may partly explain the
decline in heart disease mortality (1, 6, 7). Among persons
with diabetes, however, data on the national prevalence of
these major risk factors for cardiovascular disease are scarce.
Thus, we assembled data from the National Health and
Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) I (1971­1974),
NHANES II (1976­1980), NHANES III (1988­1994), and
the first 2 years of continuous NHANES (1999­2000),
allowing us to examine whether cardiovascular disease risk
factors have improved in people with diabetes.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Design and data collection
The NHANES is a nationally representative survey using
a stratified multistage probability design to sample the US
civilian, noninstitutionalized population. Weights are
assigned to reflect the probability of being sampled, adjusted
for oversampling, noncoverage, and nonresponse (8­13).
The study received human subject approval, and the partici-
pants were asked to sign an informed consent form.
Measures
Each NHANES consists of a detailed standardized
medical examination in a mobile examination center and an
interview to obtain information on sociodemographic vari-
ables. Weight and height are measured with standardized
techniques and equipment in the mobile examination center
and used to compute body mass index (kg/m2). For this anal-
ysis, participants were categorized as White or Black for
NHANES I and NHANES II and as non-Hispanic White,
non-Hispanic Black, or Mexican American for NHANES III
and NHANES 1999­2000; other racial or ethnic groups,
including "Hispanic other" in NHANES 1999­2000, were
included in the White category. We excluded persons aged
more than 74 years because persons in that age group were
not sampled in the first two surveys. The response rates
among adults for the four surveys were 70, 69, 77, and 76
percent, respectively.
Diagnosed diabetes was defined as a positive response to
the question, "Have you ever been told by a doctor that you
have diabetes or sugar diabetes?" In the NHANES III and
NHANES 1999­2000, women who reported being diag-
nosed only during pregnancy were not considered to have
diabetes; this information was not available for the earlier
two surveys. Three cardiovascular disease risk factors were
analyzed: serum total cholesterol concentration, systolic and
diastolic blood pressure, and smoking status.
Cholesterol measurement
For the first three surveys, a detailed description of the
procedures used for blood sample collection and measure-
ment of total cholesterol has been published (14). For
NHANES 1999­2000, a description of blood collection and
measurement of total cholesterol is provided in the NHANES
Laboratory/Medical Technologists Procedures Manual (12).
The samples were frozen at ­20°C and shipped weekly on
dry ice to the laboratory conducting the lipid analyses. The
NHANES I measurements were made in the Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention lipid standardization labora-
tory (15). The NHANES II, NHANES III, and NHANES
1999­2000 cholesterol measurements were made in labora-
tories of lipid research clinics that were standardized for
cholesterol measurements using the criteria of the Centers
for Disease Control and Prevention-National Heart, Lung,
and Blood Institute Lipid Standardization Program (16­20).
In all surveys, serum total cholesterol was measured regard-
less of fasting status. Missing data for total cholesterol
ranged from 11 percent to 1 percent. We defined high total
cholesterol concentrations as serum total cholesterol of 5.17
mmol/liter or more (200 mg/dl), regardless of use of lipid-
lowering medications.
Blood pressure measurement
As described previously (21), differences in protocol
across the four surveys included the number of blood pres-
sure measurements, the temporal sequence of blood pressure
measurements within the entire examination, types of staff
who performed the measurements, whether blood pressure
was measured in both the seated and supine positions, and
whether blood pressure measurements were performed in the
home in addition to the mobile examination center. In our
analysis, we used only blood pressure measurements
conducted in the mobile examination center with subjects in
a seated position. When more than one blood pressure
measurement was available, we calculated a mean blood
pressure. Our estimates of mean blood pressure are based on
up to two blood pressure measurements for NHANES I and
NHANES II, up to three blood pressure measurements in
NHANES III, and up to four blood pressure measurements in
NHANES 1999­2000. Because the accepted definition of
high blood pressure changed across the years of the surveys
(i.e., 1971­2000) (22­24), we defined high blood pressure
levels as a mean systolic blood pressure of 140 mmHg or
more and/or diastolic blood pressure of 90 mmHg or more
regardless of self-reported history of hypertension and use of
antihypertensive drugs.
Smoking behaviors
To determine current cigarette smoking, we asked respon-
dents the questions, "Have you smoked at least 100 ciga-
rettes in your entire life?" and "Do you smoke cigarettes
now?". Current smoking was defined by a positive answer to
both questions. In NHANES I, data on smoking behaviors
were collected for a sample of adults aged 25­74 years. For
this reason, we restricted the analysis of smoking to the
group aged 25­74 years for all four surveys. Missing data
ranged from 4.0 percent to 1.7 percent.
Statistical analysis
Statistical analyses used SAS for Windows software (25)
for data management, SUDAAN software (26) to obtain
point estimates and standard errors, and WinBUGS software
(27) to fit models. Sampling weights were used to produce
national estimates that accounted for the complex survey
design. For comparisons across surveys, data were age
adjusted by the direct method to population totals from the
2000 US Census.
Trends in the age-adjusted estimates of cardiovascular
disease risk factors were assessed using a normal hierar-
chical Bayesian model with noninformative prior distribu-
tions on model hyperparameters (28). A Bayesian approach
to modeling was preferred because inference does not
depend on asymptotic assumptions. In addition to
accounting for variability within survey measurements,
Bayesian hierarchical models account for variability
Cardiovascular Risk Factor Trends in Adults with Diabetes 533
Am J Epidemiol 2004;160:531­539
between surveys. Variability between surveys, such as meth-
odological changes, is accounted for by incorporating
random effect parameters into the model.
Our model has two levels. At the first level, we specify a
probability distribution for the observed data. Letting
denote the estimate for a cardiovascular disease risk factor
determined from survey i and 
i
2 denote the variance for
estimated from SUDAAN software, we assume
The survey means 
i
are assumed to arise from a linear
model

i
=  + (ti
­ t1
) + Zi
,
where ti
represents the midpoint year of survey i,  repre-
sents the mean value of the risk factor from the first survey
(intercept), and  represents the annual change in the risk
factor over time. The random effect Zi
represents the vari-
ability in 
i
remaining after accounting for the linear trend,
and it is assumed to be distributed N(0, 2).
At the second level of our model, we assign probability
distributions to each hyperparameter (, , ). Normal priors
with variances of 10,000 are assigned to  and , while ­1 is
approximated with a (0.001, 0.001). Combining the prior
probabilities specified at the second level with the proba-
bility distribution for the observed data specified at the first
level, we express knowledge about model parameters
through the posterior distribution derived using Bayes'
theorem. Random draws from this posterior distribution are
generated through an iterative Markov chain Monte Carlo
simulation known as the Gibbs sampler.
We simultaneously ran three Gibbs samplers and saved
50,000 of the 60,000 iterations from each. Model conver-
gence was assessed visually by inspecting trace plots of
sampled values versus iteration number and inspecting the
Gelman-Rubin statistic for each iteration. We used the mean
of the posterior distribution of  as our point estimate.
Significant decreases in cardiovascular disease risk factors
were defined by 95 percent Bayesian credible intervals for 
that did not contain zero. In addition, we estimated the prob-
ability that  is negative. A significant decrease was defined
as a probability greater than 97.5 percent. Because there is
particular interest in recent declines in the prevalence of
cardiovascular disease risk factors, we also obtained the
Bayesian estimate for the probability of a decrease between
the two most recent surveys (NHANES III and NHANES
1999­2000) for each factor. Separate Bayesian models were
fit for the overall population, men, women, and persons aged
20­59 and 60­74 years.
RESULTS
The characteristics of adults with diabetes are presented in
table 1. The proportion of people with a high school degree
or higher increased from 1971 to 2000. The mean body mass
index was stable between 1971­1974 and 1976­1980 but
increased between 1976­1980 and 1999­2000.
Trends in total cholesterol
During the 30-year period, age-adjusted mean total choles-
terol decreased ­0.02 (95 percent credible interval: ­0.03,
­0.01) mmol/liter (­0.6 mg/dl), from 5.95 mmol/liter (230
mg/dl) to 5.48 mmol/liter (212 mg/dl). The probability that
the mean total cholesterol concentration decreased over the
30-year period was 99.3 percent, and between the two most
recent surveys it was 99.7 percent. This decline was of a
greater magnitude in persons aged 60­74 years than in those
aged 20­59 years (table 2). In addition, in both age groups
most of the decrease occurred between NHANES III and

NHANES 1999­2000. In the whole population (aged 20­74
years), the proportion of those with total cholesterol values
of 5.17 mmol/liter (200 mg/dl) decreased from 72 percent
in 1971 to 55 percent in 2000 (figure 1), with a mean change
per year of ­0.6 (95 percent credible interval: ­1.7, 0.6)
percentage point and a probability of decrease of 91.8
percent. Between 1988­1994 and 1999­2000, the proba-
bility of a decline in the prevalence of high total cholesterol
was 99.0 percent.
In men, total cholesterol concentrations declined by 0.62
mmol/liter (24 mg/dl), and the change from 1988­1994 to
1999­2000 was also significant (table 3). The yearly esti-
mated decrease in the percentage of men with high total
cholesterol was ­0.7 percentage point (table 3).
Over the 30-year period, women experienced an annual
decline in mean total cholesterol that was smaller than that
for men (table 4). From 1988­1994 to 1999­2000, the prob-
ability of a decrease was 78.7 percent (table 4). The propor-
tion of women with high total cholesterol was stable in the
first three surveys but decreased significantly between the
third and fourth (table 4).
Trends in blood pressure
From 1971 to 2000, the mean systolic blood pressure
declined ­0.5 (95 percent credible interval: ­1.1, 0.5) mmHg
annually (a probability of decrease of 93.5 percent) but
showed little change between 1988 and 2000 (a probability
of decrease of 17.4 percent). A similar pattern and magni-
tude of change in systolic blood pressure were seen for both
sexes and age groups (tables 2, 3, and 4). From 1971 to 2000,
the mean diastolic blood pressure declined ­0.6 (95 percent
credible interval: ­1.0, ­0.03) mmHg per year. The magni-
tude of change was similar among men and women but
somewhat higher among persons aged 60­74 years than
among those younger (tables 2, 3, and 4). Between the 1988

blood pressure decreased from 60 percent to 31 percent (a
probability of decrease of 95.0 percent), and the proportion
of women with high blood pressure decreased from 67
percent to 43 percent (a probability of decrease of 89.4
percent). Between 1988 and 2000, little change was seen in
the proportion of persons with high blood pressure for either
sex or any age group.
Trends in smoking
The age-adjusted prevalence of cigarette smoking among
persons with diabetes dropped 15 percent (figure 1), with a
median annual change of ­0.5 (95 percent credible interval:
­1.4, 0.6) percentage point per year (a probability of decline
of 89.5 percent). The magnitude of decrease was greatest for
men, but it was limited to NHANES I through NHANES III
(table 3). Among women, the decline occurred over all four
surveys (table 4).
Trends in multiple risk factors
The age-adjusted percentages of persons with diabetes and
at least one, at least two, or all three cardiovascular disease
risk factors (high total cholesterol, high blood pressure, or
current smoking) were also estimated. Over the study period,
the proportion of persons with diabetes who had at least one
risk factor decreased from 92 percent to 74 percent, with the
greatest decline between NHANES III and NHANES 1999­
2000 (from 81 percent to 74 percent; a probability of
decrease of 96.6 percent) (data not shown). The percentage
of those with two risk factors also decreased steadily from
1971­1974 to 1999­2000, with a median change of ­1.0 (95
percent credible interval: ­2.1, 0.1) percentage point (data
not shown). The percentage of persons with all three risk
factors was 15 percent in NHANES I but fell to 3 percent in
NHANES III and NHANES 1999­2000 (data not shown).
DISCUSSION
In the US adult population with diabetes, the prevalence of
high total cholesterol, high blood pressure levels, and
smoking declined by 17, 27, and 15 percentage points,
respectively, over three decades. Reductions in mean total
cholesterol tended to be greater among men than women and
in older (60­74 years) than younger (20­59 years) adults.
Declines in mean blood pressure levels were similar across
sex and age, but improvement tended to stop after 1988­
1994. Smoking prevalence also decreased in both men and
women, but these reductions were mainly in earlier decades
among men (1970s and 1980s) and in the most recent decade
among women (1990s). Taken as a whole, these findings are
encouraging, as successful control of these risk factors has
been associated with considerable reductions in the cardio-
vascular and microvascular complications of diabetes (3,
29­31).
Recent data for the US general population have indicated a
reduction in the temporal declines in mean cholesterol
concentrations for both men and women (32, 33). In contrast,
we found that, among people with diabetes, total cholesterol
continued to decline from 1988­1994 to 1999­2000, espe-
cially in men and in younger as well as older adults. In
women, cholesterol values were stable up to 1988­1994 and
then declined. The overall improvement in recent years may
reflect the aggressive promotion of lipid control in persons
with diabetes, following the results of clinical trials of lipid-

Cardiovascular Risk Factor Trends in Adults with Diabetes 537
Am J Epidemiol 2004;160:531­539
In 1999­2000, half of the adults with diabetes had total
cholesterol concentrations above the level recommended by
the National Cholesterol Education Program (5.17 mmol/
liter or 200 mg/dl) (38). Our results underscore the need to
enforce current recommendations to consider diabetes a risk
factor for heart disease and to aggressively treat lipid abnor-
malities in people who have diabetes. We note that, even if
the decline in the proportion of adults with diabetes having
high total cholesterol levels would continue at 0.6
percentage point per year (the annual decrease we found for
the entire study period), 49 percent of people with diabetes
will still have high cholesterol levels in 2010.
Findings from randomized trials have demonstrated the
benefits of tight blood pressure control to protect against
renal disease and cardiovascular events in patients with
diabetes (30, 39, 40). For this reason, more stringent criteria
for blood pressure control have been suggested for this group
(24, 41). Even so, we found that the proportion of persons
with blood pressure above 140/90 mmHg did not decrease
between 1988­1994 and 1999­2000 and, at the last survey, a
substantial proportion of US adults with diabetes still had a
blood pressure measurement above 140/90 mmHg. More
recently, the recommended blood pressure for people with
diabetes has been lowered to 130/80 mmHg (41); on the
basis of this new criterion, an even greater proportion of
persons with diabetes will be candidates for intervention.
The favorable changes in the major cardiovascular disease
risk factors among adults with diabetes have occurred along-
side a dramatic increase in mean body mass index. Like
diabetes, obesity is associated with insulin resistance, hyper-
tension, lipid abnormalities (42), and cardiovascular disease
mortality (43). Thus, one would have expected results the
opposite of what we obtained. It is possible that the shift in
body mass index reflects an increase in detecting undiag-
nosed diabetes, because people are at an earlier stage and
have less severe disease. Similarly, changes in the diagnostic
criteria for diabetes in the most recent years and increased
screening may help to identify individuals with a less severe
form of the disease, who would likely have a better cardio-
vascular disease risk profile. If true, this could in part explain
the downward trend in risk factors.
Despite the favorable trends in the three major risk factors
for cardiovascular disease, a national study found that heart
disease mortality had declined to a lesser degree among
adults with diabetes than in the US general population (5).
There are a few potential explanations for this. First, many
risk factors other than the three we studied are associated
with cardiovascular disease mortality in people with
diabetes. For example, low high-density lipoprotein choles-
terol, high triglycerides, abnormal low density lipoprotein
particle size, hyperinsulinemia and insulin resistance, coagu-
lation abnormalities, inflammation, and physical inactivity
all can increase susceptibility to atherosclerosis in diabetes
(44). Second, it may require additional time before a decline
in cardiovascular disease risk factors is reflected in changes
in cardiovascular disease mortality. Finally, people with
diabetes may derive less benefit from the medical treatment
of cardiovascular disease. For example, they experience
worse outcomes of coronary revascularization than do
persons without diabetes (45) and have an adverse long-term
prognosis after myocardial infarction (46). Moreover,
among patients with coronary artery disease, those with
diabetes are less often tested or treated for dislipidemia (47).
Our study had some limitations. First, the sample size of
people with diabetes, especially in the most recent survey,
limited the number of stratified subgroup analyses that we
could conduct. Second, differences in participation rates by
race/ethnicity may have varied over time, which may have
influenced the findings. We were unable to examine this in
our analyses, because of the fact that the number of people
with diabetes and non-White race was too small to provide
reliable or meaningful inferences and because information
on race/ethnicity was not collected uniformly across the four
surveys. However, we conducted follow-up sensitivity anal-
yses in which we estimated cardiovascular disease risk factor
levels across the four surveys only in non-White partici-
pants. We found that trends among non-Whites were of
similar magnitude to that observed in the overall sample, but
the standard errors were very large because of the small
sample size. Third, given the lack of data from the earliest
survey, we could not assess temporal trends in high density
lipoprotein cholesterol, low density lipoprotein cholesterol,
and triglycerides. Fourth, some of the methodological
changes that occurred across the four surveys may have
influenced our estimates, especially for blood pressure
levels. Our choice of analytical approach reduces the effect
of these changes on our estimates; thus, we believe that most
of the observed decline in cardiovascular disease risk factors
is real.
In conclusion, between 1971 and 2000, cardiovascular
disease risk factors among people with diabetes declined.
The biggest declines were among men and older people.
Although we have strong evidence that control of blood
pressure, lipids, and smoking can reduce cardiovascular
disease mortality among people with diabetes, one of two
people with diabetes still has a total cholesterol concentra-
tion above the recommended targets, one of three has high
blood pressure, and one of six is a smoker. Considerable
opportunity to tackle cardiovascular disease risk in people
with diabetes still exists.
