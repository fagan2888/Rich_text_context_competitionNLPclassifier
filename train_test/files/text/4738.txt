Special Issue - Reusing Qualitative Data
Reusing Qualitative Data Becomes
Accepted
It has now been more than two decades since the founding of
the United Kingdom's Qualidata, one of the earliest initia-
tives in the world to archive social science qualitative data
and make them available for reuse on a national scale (Corti,
2000). Qualidata paved the way for others, eventually inte-
grating with the UK Data Archive (UKDA), part of the larger
UK Data Service, which now disseminates nearly 1,000
qualitative and mixed-methods data sets, more than half of
which are available through the Service's more recently
established self-archiving system, ReShare (reshare.ukdatas-
ervice.ac.uk).
The period from 2000 has seen a boom in both the drivers
of data sharing and the development of human and material
capability to do so. Research funders are increasingly man-
dating easy or open access to research data and data manage-
ment plans to ensure maximum quality, sustainability,
accessibility, and openness of research data. Publishers of
academic findings demand that the supporting data can be
accessed for scrutiny or further exploration. Governments
internationally are demanding transparency in research, and
the economic climate makes it desirable for much greater
reuse of data to maximize the return on science investments
(Corti, Van den Eynden, Bishop, & Woollard, 2014).
In parallel with the promotion of, and support for data
sharing, there are also indicators of growing acceptance of
secondary analysis of qualitative data as a recognized meth-
odology. The UK National Centre for Research Methods
publishes a vocabulary of categories of research methods in
the social sciences. First published in 2004, it listed the term
"secondary analysis" with no sub-categories (Beissel-
Durrant, 2004). By 2015, the entry for secondary analysis
had numerous sub-classifications: archival research, docu-
mentary research, analysis of official statistics, analysis of
existing survey data, analysis of administrative data, and last
(but surely with no imputation of being least) analysis of sec-
ondary qualitative data (Luff, Byatt, & Martin, 2015).
The methodology is also appearing more frequently in
methods textbooks. One of the earliest examples is by Corti

Revisiting Qualitative Data Reuse:
A Decade On
Libby Bishop1 and Arja Kuula-Luumi2
Abstract
Secondary analysis of qualitative data entails reusing data created from previous research projects for new purposes. Reuse
provides an opportunity to study the raw materials of past research projects to gain methodological and substantive insights.
In the past decade, use of the approach has grown rapidly in the United Kingdom to become sufficiently accepted that it
must now be regarded as mainstream. Several factors explain this growth: the open data movement, research funders' and
publishers' policies supporting data sharing, and researchers seeing benefits from sharing resources, including data. Another
factor enabling qualitative data reuse has been improved services and infrastructure that facilitate access to thousands of
data collections. The UK Data Service is an example of a well-established facility; more recent has been the proliferation of
repositories being established within universities. This article will provide evidence of the growth of data reuse in the United
Kingdom and in Finland by presenting both data and case studies of reuse that illustrate the breadth and diversity of this
maturing research method. We use two distinct data sources that quantify the scale, types, and trends of reuse of qualitative
data: (a) downloads of archived data collections held at data repositories and (b) publication citations. Although the focus of
this article is on the United Kingdom, some discussion of the international environment is provided, together with data and
examples of reuse at the Finnish Social Science Data Archive. The conclusion summarizes the major findings, including some
conjectures regarding what makes qualitative data attractive for reuse and sharing.

and Thompson (2004) in Seale et al.'s Sage Publications
compendium, Qualitative Research Practice, with an
updated version that appeared in 2011. Another best-selling
textbook for qualitative research, David Silverman's
Qualitative Research, first published a chapter on reuse of
qualitative data by Clive Seale in 2011 (Seale, 2011). The
presence of an entirely new chapter in the fourth edition
gives yet more support to the claim that qualitative second-
ary analysis has become an established and recognized
research method (Bishop, 2016).
In this article, we highlight recent changes in data sharing
policies and infrastructures in the United Kingdom that have
facilitated sharing of qualitative data. Then we present a vari-
ety of forms of evidence about the scale, nature, and growth
in the practice of data reuse. The final sections of the article
discuss recent case studies of research using secondary anal-
ysis. We conclude that, despite some limitations on the avail-
able evidence, there are strong indications of growing reuse
of data.
A Brief History of Data Sharing:
Policies and Infrastructure
The development of policies and infrastructure to support the
reuse of qualitative data has gone hand-in-hand with the
development of an ethos of data sharing; both are necessary
if data are to be made available for sharing and valued as a
resource for reuse.
Policies
The process of enabling data sharing has developed in a wide
variety of ways when viewed comparatively across Europe.
This was shown clearly by Ruusalepp (2008) who compre-
hensively reviewed developments across the 30 countries of
theOrganisationforEconomicCooperationandDevelopment
(OECD). He showed that organizations such as the OECD,
UNESCO, European Strategy Forum on Research
Infrastructures (ESFRI), and The Committee on Data for
Science and Technology (CODATA) had policies that pro-
moted or recommended data sharing, and that these policies
influenced the development of numerous UK organizations
(e.g., Office of Science and Innovation [e-Infrastructure],
Jisc Strategy 2007-2009, and the Research Information
Network's Strategic Plan). These policies stopped short of
recommending mandatory data sharing.
To date, there are no unified national policies across the
countries of the OECD that mandate data sharing in this way,
although there is an increase in requirements for "data man-
agement plans," which ask researchers to take into account
data sharing and curation, most notably in 2011 by the
Research Councils UK and by the National Science
Foundation in the United States. The European Commission
Horizon 2020 program of funding ran a pilot project requir-
ing data management plans to be submitted alongside
applications (European Commission, 2013). The ethos of
data sharing is strongly endorsed within these policies and is
beginning to have a discernible impact at the organizational
level.
Dating back to the 1970s, the United Kingdom's Economic
and Social Research Council or its predecessor has had a
research data policy that has required all award holders to
offer their quantitative data to be formally archived. In 1995,
qualitative data were added to this mandate, and similar obli-
gations continued in the 2010 and 2015 policies (Economic
and Social Research Council, 2015b). The Council's recently
revised Framework for Research Ethics notes that ethical
considerations apply to data archiving, sharing, linking, and
reuse, as well as data collection and research publication
(Economic and Social Research Council, 2015a).
Although other public research funders have published
similar policies, a milestone was the adoption of the Common
Principles on Data Policy adopted by all research councils in
2011 (Research Councils UK, 2011). A subsequent Policy on
Access to Research Outputs (Research Councils UK, 2012)
required funded peer-reviewed research papers to be pub-
lished in journals that are compliant with the Policy on Open
Access, and to include a statement on how the underlying
research materials such as data, samples, or models can be
accessed. Across UK higher education institutions, 55% of
research is funded by the research councils, an annual invest-
ment of about £3 billion, and thus such policies strongly
influence research practices (Higher Education Statistics
Agency, 2012).
Data Sharing Infrastructure
A further important influence on data sharing has been the
willingness of UK funders to underwrite projects that are
fully or partially engaged in making data available for shar-
ing. In the realm of infrastructure for qualitative data, these
include continuing support for the UK Data Service, includ-
ing bringing in enhanced user services such as QualiBank, a
system for online searching and browsing of qualitative data
(UK Data Service, 2013), and funding for a major qualitative
longitudinal data repository as part of the Timescapes proj-
ect, housed at the University of Leeds (Timescapes
Repository, 2015). And, around the world, national funding
agencies have begun to support national pilots for qualitative
data sharing. However, investment is typically cautious and
for fixed periods of time, thus making the long-term sustain-
ability of an archive somewhat precarious.
As recently as 2011, Corti reported that only two European
countries, that are part of the broader Council of European
Social Science Data Archives (CESSDA), the United
Kingdom and Finland, had "mature infrastructures" for qual-
itative data sharing. Since then, there has been progress with
several other European archives that were initially estab-
lished for quantitative data now accepting qualitative data as
well (e.g.,Swiss Foundation for Research in Social Sciences
Bishop and Kuula-Lummi 3
[FORS], GESIS - Leibniz Institute for the Social Sciences in
Germany, Norwegian Centre for Research Data [NSD], and
Social Science DataArchives [ADP] in Slovenia). Elsewhere
in Europe, specialist research centers are storing and making
their data collections available. QualiService, at the
University of Bremen, focuses on life course interviews and
methods and has short-term support from the central German
research funder, DFG (QualiService, 2016). A new facility in
Poland, the Archives of Qualitative Data at the Institute of
Philosophy and Sociology in the PolishAcademy of Sciences,
opened in 2013. Other successful infrastructure develop-
ments include the integration of the Irish Qualitative Data
Archive into the national Digital Repository of Ireland, hous-
ing a whole spectrum of social and cultural Irish data. Neale
and Bishop (2010-2011) provide a summary of the state of
play of a selection of European qualitative archives as they
were in 2010.
Developments extend beyond Europe as well. In the
United States, the long-standing Henry A. Murray Centre,
which holds data on the life course, is housed at Harvard
University. A newly founded Qualitative Data Repository,
supported by the U.S. National Science Foundation (NSF), is
hosted by the Center for Qualitative and Multi-Method
Inquiry, a unit of the Maxwell School of Citizenship and
Public Affairs at Syracuse University. The repository's initial
emphasis is on political science, but it already has plans to
cover social sciences more broadly (Qualitative Data
Repository, 2015). In Australia, Research Data Australia
holds a small but growing number of qualitative data sets,
and the Inter-University Consortium for Political and Social
Research data archive at the University of Michigan has
recently begun holding some qualitative data as well.
Scale of Collections
The UK Data Service currently holds nearly 1,000 qualita-
tive and mixed-methods collections that are accessible from
the catalogue (UK Data Service, 2016). The Finnish Social
Science DataArchive (FSD) began archiving qualitative data
in 2003, and over the following 12 years, as many as 177
qualitative data sets have been deposited. A new longitudinal
Finnish project will collect data from 100 young people over
the next 10 years. Inspired by the Timescapes Project, the
Finnish researchers aim to conduct their project in close
cooperation with Timescapes and to deposit all the data col-
lected during the project.
In other cases, however, the amounts of data being han-
dled within the archives are typically quite small, some
dozens of collections at the most, and the staff time avail-
able for the processing of qualitative data is often limited.
In Germany, GESIS, which curates predominantly quanti-
tative data, also holds 64 qualitative collections.
QualiService, the repository for life course research
located in Bremen, holds 14 collections, but each one is
large, with the total number of interviews greater than
1,730. The social science data archives in Switzerland and
Slovenia each holds fewer than 10 qualitative and mixed
collections, although, again, a single collection may con-
tain up to 200 qualitative interviews.
This summary of the current situation for data sharing
policies and infrastructures is, inevitably, partial. There are
initiatives in many other countries, albeit these are typically
small-scale and very modestly funded. Although the changes
may not be happening with blinding speed, there does seem
to be a reasonable pace of steady growth.
Measuring Reuse of Data
It can be challenging to quantify and measure the reuse of
data, but there have been many recent advances, partly driven
by funders' requirements to measure impact from research.
Ball and Duke (2015) discuss many recent innovations in
measuring data use as part of the effort to measure research
impact. Metrics currently in use include citations of specific
data collections, resolutions to a unique persistent identifier
(such as a Digital Object Identifier, or DOI), page views of a
web site where a data catalogue record is rendered, and
downloads of the data (the user transfers a copy of the data
set from a repository to another location). Additional explor-
atory measures are being used, such as tracking mentions on
social media. Commercial metrics services are proliferating
in this area as well, the best known being the Thomson­
Reuters Data Citation Index, which displays the number of
times a data set has been cited in the Web of Science.
Ball and Duke acknowledge limitations of such efforts:
Some measurements are very noisy, duplications are not
always controlled, and--as with almost any metric--the sys-
tem can be gamed. This applies equally when attempting to
measure use of qualitative data. At the UK Data Service, all
users are asked to fully cite data they use in any publications,
and every data collection record contains a block of citation
text, ready to copy and paste, including a DOI. However, in
practice, many authors use partial or non-standard citations,
or worse, fail to cite data at all. As a result, it remains a costly
manual process to obtain detailed information about reuse. In
time, encouragement to cite data using DOIs that can be eas-
ily found through a web search will help automate some of
this counting work (Farquhar & Brase, 2014).
In this article, we use two distinct data sources that quan-
tify the scale, types, and trends of reuse of qualitative data:
(a) downloads of data collections held at two data reposito-
ries and (b) publication citations. The first measure is the
frequency and nature of downloads of qualitative data from
the UK Data Service and FSD, and the second is citations of
publications that have used or discussed secondary analysis
of qualitative data. Although these sources have their limita-
tions, each one provides new and useful knowledge about the
reuse of qualitative data, particularly in light of the dearth of
empirical information and the measurement difficulties iden-
tified above.

Measuring Data Reuse Using Information From
Data Downloads
UK Data Service. The source of data for this research was
based on information collected by the UK Data Service
whenever a data collection from the main curated collec-
tion is downloaded. (This analysis updates and improves a
previous study of similar data conducted in 2014 [Bishop,
2014].) We began by establishing the number of data col-
lections for which information on access was available.
Collections categorized as either qualitative or mixed were
included across the period, 2002-2016. There were 444
curated collections in scope, which excludes more than
500 that have become more recently available (from 2011)
via the ReShare self-deposit system. Of these 444, 40%
(177) have never been downloaded. In a few cases, data
were not accessible to users for reasons of embargo or
because data had been withdrawn, but most collections
were available but had just not been accessed. The remain-
ing 60% (267) had been downloaded at least once, and
these 267 collections are the source for the following
analysis.
After establishing the number of collections, we then
had to define and count "unique downloads" of each col-
lection. Uniqueness in this case is defined as a specific
user accessing data for a specific preregistered project. The
sample that we investigated is based on 7,155 unique
downloads of 267 possible data collections. For each
download, additional information was available from
details that users provide when they register with the UK
Data Service: user affiliation, user discipline, and a brief
(30-word minimum) description of the specific project for
which the data were downloaded. When data are provided
as open access with no user registration required, then
measurement of a download is no longer possible in this
manner. However, prior to 2013, almost no qualitative col-
lections were available as open data.
The maximum number of times a single collection was
downloaded was 366, with a mean of 13 and median of 27.
In this analysis, and as shown in Table 1, 40% (108) of the
collections were used 1 to 10 times, 54% (144) were used 11
to 100 times, and 6% (15) were used more than 100 times. It
is thus the case that a modest proportion of collections
received the heaviest usage; similar usage patterns have been
found for use of quantitative data at the UK Data Service.
Figure 1 presents the breakdown of who uses data.
Overall, 42% of the downloads were by postgraduate stu-
dents, 25% by undergraduates, and 27% by staff members at
institutions of higher education. The remaining 6% com-
prised other staff, other students, people using data for per-
sonal or genealogical research, and commercial users.
Next, the reuse projects were classified into several broad
categories of depending on the purposes for which the data
were being used: research, teaching, and learning. To qualify
as research, the project description had to include sufficient
detail to suggest a plausible research project. PhD projects
were automatically included in research unless the descrip-
tion specified that the data were being used only for explor-
atory purposes, that is, for learning. "Learning" projects
typically mentioned that the data were being used to com-
plete an assignment; all master's and undergraduate projects
were classified as learning. A project was categorized as
teaching if that purpose was mentioned. The majority of the
teaching projects involved the teaching of qualitative
research methods. In the cases where we were not able to
differentiate, we used the category Teaching/Learning and
assigned the category partly based on the type of user (edu-
cational staff or student).
Figure 2 shows that 15% (1,073) of the downloads were
used for research, 13% (957) for teaching, and the significant
majority, 64% (4,559) were for learning. The remaining 8%
were either miscellaneous uses or unclassifiable due to insuf-
ficient information in the project descriptions.
In addition to the broad pattern of teaching and learning
use, we are also able to say a bit more about the breakdown
between undergraduates and postgraduates within each group
(see Tables 2 and 3). For teaching, the share of postgraduate-
level teaching was somewhat higher than for undergraduate
teaching (32% vs. 23%). Nearly half of the observations
could not be classified into either category. However, for
learning, a quite substantial majority (58%) were postgradu-
ates compared with 39% of the learning uses reported by
undergraduates. Given that much of the teaching use was for
courses in research methods, and these are more common at
the postgraduate level, this finding is not surprising, but does
add useful detail as well as suggest possible opportunities to
expand the reuse of data for undergraduate teaching.
For any archive, it is important to understand what it is that
makes a collection a good candidate for reuse. This study
looked for patterns in the characteristics of the collections that
are being reused most often. The list of most used collections

(see Table 4) is highly varied, making patterns hard to ascer-
tain, but some features clearly stood out. Mixed-methods col-
lections and collections with multiple types of data are used,
perhaps because of the convenience of learning about several
genres of data within one study. Topics tended to be current
and to be relevant for policy debates, for example, crime, gen-
der, social exclusion, and food. In addition, some collections
not in the top five but still highly ranked might be seen to
appeal to a younger generation of students: youth into adult
transitions, youth crime, and cannabis use. However, in addi-
tion to specific focused studies, oral histories covering a
breadth of topics are also used heavily.
We believe the key finding from this research is the scale
and significance of the reuse of data for teaching and learn-
ing. Although there is sometimes a tendency to privilege data
reuse for research, the widespread use across several levels
of education is clearly enriching teaching by the use of real
data. This is certainly consistent with recommendations from
several higher education authorities regarding the impor-
tance and value to learners of research-led teaching (Blair,
2015). In some project descriptions, methods teachers noted
that their students learned qualitative methods best if they
were able to use actual data that matched their interests. In
her project description, one instructor wrote, "Real interview
data is effective in engaging student interest." It would seem
that being engaged with the specific topics the data describe
is more effective at motivating students to learn methodol-
ogy than working with generic or artificial data. Our analysis
revealed another finding: Active promotion of a study, by
either a particular faculty member or by the UK Data Service,
dramatically increases the use of its data. We can see this
effect when teachers repeatedly assign students to use data
they have generated for teaching, which we know has hap-
pened for several of the most frequently used collections,
notably the highest ranked collection on gender and crime
(Hollway & Jefferson, 2003).
Teachers, especially recent PhDs, have the benefit of
expertise in their subject area, but often, they will not have
had the time or opportunity to build a broad repertoire of
materials with which they are well acquainted and make
them available for teaching. Archives are perfectly suited to
filling that gap. (See Haaker & Morgan Brett, 2016, in this
issue, for a more extensive treatment of reusing data for
teaching.) This is a need that data centers are ideally posi-
tioned to meet. Archives can offer a wide range of types of
data from diverse methods of qualitative research. In addi-
tion, archives are able to promote their distinctive holdings
through teaching resources.
The challenge in developing appealing teaching
resources is, as always, the time, effort, and cost to pro-
duce them. However, even smaller data centers have used
this strategy successfully, and often, a strategy of co-pro-
duction with data creators can be deployed. The Irish
Qualitative Data Archive (2015) produced a series of
learning resources based on archived data from the Life
Histories and Social Change Project. The resources consist
of guided introductions to key sociological concepts, such
as social class, using audio and text extracts from life his-
tory interviews. In a second example, Mass Observation is
a key historical resource of popular accounts of everyday
life in the United Kingdom produced by a panel of record-
ers who respond to thematic directives (e.g., life under aus-
terity). A variety of learning activities are supported, for
example, English teachers in higher and further education
use its resources for inspiration for creative writing or per-
formance (Mass Observation Archive, 2015). All these
examples demonstrate that providing archived data to
teachers enables innovations in substantive and methods
instruction. Although requiring an investment, there are
two obvious benefits for archives: Usage numbers for the
promoted data will rise, and a next generation of research-
ers will learn to see reuse of qualitative data as a routine
and normal part of their methods training. This would be a
significant accomplishment.
Finnish Data Service. The FDS is usefully compared with the
UK Data Service because it has held qualitative data for
more than a decade and collects similar usage statistics.
Since 2007, there have been between 70 and 95 requests for
qualitative data sets annually from FSD, and after launching
the online data service "Aila" in mid-2014, the number of
reusers of qualitative data sets increased (Finnish Social Sci-
ence Data Archive, 2016). In 2015, there were 323 down-
loads of qualitative data sets, and over the 18 months period
since the launch, 550 unique reuse projects were identified:
41% (224) for undergraduate study, 28% (155) for master's
theses, 20% (108) for teaching, and 11% (63) for research, as
shown in Figure 3. The categories used are somewhat differ-
ent from those used by the UK Data Service; however, the
pattern of a significant majority of reuse for teaching and
learning holds in both countries. The higher figure for

research in the United Kingdom (15% vs. 11% in Finland)
may be due to including PhD work in research in the United
Kingdom.
Reuse of archived qualitative data in Finland for teaching
and studying makes up more than 60% of all applications for
data. Finnish methods teachers usually want to demonstrate
different kinds of analytical methods and a variety of research
questions to students by using a single data collection, with
teachers themselves often selecting a sample from an
archived data set. Students using the data archive's resources
often write their masters theses based solely on archived
qualitative data sets. Compared with collecting their own
data for the theses, using archived data has the advantage of
allowing students to spend significantly more time on think-
ing, analysis, and interpretation rather than on data collection
(Haynes & Jones, 2012).
Measuring Trends in Data Reuse
Having looked at the overall picture of qualitative data reuse
by purpose and user type, with comparative data from the
United Kingdom and Finland, we next investigated the pat-
tern of data reuse over time. In this section, two data sources
are presented: the UK Data Service downloads analyzed
above, and data from a citation search on Web of Science.
In Figure 4, we show the number of qualitative and mixed
data downloads from the UK Data Service per year from
2002 to 2016. The first 10 years show a fairly steady rate of
increase, rising to a peak of just more than 900 downloads in
2011. This is followed by a decline, then leveling out at about
700 per year from 2013 to 2015. The shaded area for the year
2016 is the extrapolation if the rate for the first 2 months of
the year continues. We do not know of any factors that would
have contributed to the peak in 2011, but the overall pattern
is broadly consistent with the use of all data types from the
UK Data Service (Economic and Social Research Council,
2012 and other years).
The second measure of reuse over time used in this arti-
cle involved a web-based search for articles that had reused
qualitative data in their analyses or discussed the technique.
The Thomson­Reuters Web of Science (webofknowledge.
com) citation metrics portal was used to extract information,
and we chose a 25-year period, 1990-2015. We defined
search criteria that would return articles that had reused
qualitative data, specifying either of the two phrases: "quali-
tative research" or "qualitative study(ies)." A second com-
ponent was added using the AND Boolean using "secondary
analysis" or "reuse" as both terms are applied to repurposing
of data. We placed no restrictions on the disciplines of the
publications.
This method has significant limitations. Other genres of
qualitative research, such as ethnography, content analysis, and
case studies, all could have involved secondary analysis with-
out containing any of the keywords we chose. However, to use
additional keywords would have required far more extensive
content analysis of each article, which we were not in a position
to undertake.Also, we were not able to be certain if each article
used the method, although a review of abstracts and selected
content indicated that most did. This analysis, then, may

overcount by including some articles that did not actually use
secondary analysis, but it also undercounts by omitting reuse
research that did not use our chosen search terms.
The search results produced the number of articles pub-
lished that, by our definition, were likely to have conducted
secondary analysis of qualitative data.
The number of publications identified was almost zero until
1997 when five items were published (Figure 5). The number
then increased to almost 50 per year by 2014, dropping to 36 in
2015 to reach a total of 347 over 25 years. The increase has
been somewhat uneven, with fluctuations in several years.
A similar, but more narrowly circumscribed, search was
conducted by Yardley, Watts, Pearson, and Richardson
(2014). They searched for all articles that mentioned use of
secondary analysis of qualitative data with a focus on ethi-
cal issues, especially consent, over the period 1994 to
2010. Their goal was to "identify and critique the `state of
the science' related to secondary analysis with particular
focus on issues of consent" (p. 104). The search terms they
used were "qualitative and ethics" and "consent and sec-
ondary analysis." Using these more restrictive criteria,
they found 154 references. With the differences in search

terms and time periods between our own search and
Yardley's, an exact comparison of results is not possible.
Nonetheless, given that ethical concerns have been promi-
nent in debates about reusing qualitative data, it is not
implausible that articles that address ethical issues could
comprise roughly half of all articles about secondary anal-
ysis of qualitative data.
Summary of Data About Qualitative Data Reuse
Here, we summarize a few key findings about data reuse
from the UK Data Service, FSD, and the analysis of publica-
tions. Significantly, the majority of the data collections have
been used at least once. The concern that vast quantities of
data are being archived but never touched is demonstrably
not the case. And it is clear in both the United Kingdom and
Finland that the main purposes are for education: Students
and staff in educational institutions make up most users, and
learning is nearly twice as frequent as all other uses com-
bined in the United Kingdom. In terms of understanding
trends of reuse over time, the evidence suggests a fairly rapid
rate of growth in early years. This is not surprising, given the
low initial base. The most recent data have suggested the
growth may have stabilized, but it is not possible to tell
whether the previously rapid growth will resume.
To our knowledge, this is the most robust and detailed
data available on the actual practices of reusing qualitative
data. That said, these data have significant limitations and
the inferences need to be modest. We know we are over-
counting usage of qualitative data by including mixed-meth-
ods studies. However, there is also substantial undercounting
as these data did not include usages from the UK Data
Service self-archiving system, ReShare, which hosts more
than 500 collections of qualitative data (excluded for reasons
of not being able to obtain comparable metrics at this time).
It is also the case that high variability of the descriptions
reusers is a constraint. There is an inevitable tension at work:
Demanding more information from reusers would certainly
reduce actual reuse, but minimal information limits the
potential scope of any analysis. Improved integration in
internal systems at the UK Data Service may be able to
address some of these issues.
Later in this article, we will return to the question of what
seems to make some topics and disciplines more inclined to
use secondary analysis of qualitative data.
Diverse Approaches to Reusing
Qualitative Data for Research
The first half of this article has addressed the following ques-
tions: How often are archived qualitative data reused, for
what purposes, and by whom? In the second half, we look in
more detail at how have data been reused in several research
projects and consider these usages in light of the debate
about the role of context when reusing qualitative data. This
assessment also contributes some better understanding of
what makes a data collection a good candidate for reuse.
The examples of reuse presented below have been selected
to capture the variety of research using secondary analysis of
qualitative data across dimensions of method, subject, data
sources, and the connections, if any, between primary and
secondary researchers. Another dimension of interest is the
extent to which the reuse project drew upon extensive con-
text of the primary research project.At the time when reusing
data was less common, this "context debate" was quite pro-
nounced, and has been usefully summarized by Hammersley
(2010). In this section, we hope to advance the debate beyond
what has been, at times, often speculative discussion by
looking at actual research practice and the role context has
played in successful research projects that have reused quali-
tative data.
Ten years ago, Jennifer Mason (2007) had already observed
the progress made when researchers moved beyond overly
moralist debates about reuse to "get on and do it" (par.1.3).
The diversity and quality of these cases suggest that, over the
past decade, researchers have continued to do just that.
Moreover, these cases demonstrate that a kind of pluralism of
approaches to secondary analysis has emerged and expanded.
For some approaches, deep knowledge of the original context
is highly beneficial, perhaps even essential. In others, usage
of data seems to proceed with equally good outcomes with
little need for it.
Before turning in more detail to several UK cases, it is
helpful to consider the rather different environment for data
sharing that exists in Finland. There are valuable insights
from recent evidence from Finnish users as to how much
context they actually require to proceed with analyzing
another's data. The non-binding policy and funding frame-
work in Finland, which recommends archiving data rather
than requiring it, has framed the FSD's expectations of
depositors regarding what they need to do as part of their
data sharing activities. FSD has fairly modest expectations
for depositors because it was felt that demanding compre-
hensive descriptions of the methodology and analyses used
in primary research would have decreased the willingness of
researchers to archive their data and resulted in far less data
being made available. Instead, archivists have been able to
reassure researchers that the workload required by the
archiving process will not be onerous.
As a result, the FSD focuses on ensuring that the data are
fully documented, but do not seek extensive documentation
of the primary project. In practice, this means providing
information about fieldwork and data collection methods
(e.g., questionnaire, interview instructions, sample design)
together with background information about participants for
each data file (e.g., an interview), but little or no detail about
the primary project itself, why it was done, and so on. This
level of documentation seems to be sufficient for many users'
requirements, as most of them do not seem to have an inter-
est in replicating the original research. For teaching research
10 SAGE Open
methods, samples of qualitative data sets are used in Finland
much more often than whole data sets.And for more substan-
tive research, archived qualitative data are often used to sup-
plement the researcher's own data or intended data. This type
of reuse is demonstrated in the query below from a Finnish
researcher seeking data:
I am writing a research plan. My research concentrates on the
meaningful life and happiness of elderly women living alone. To
get new ideas and insights, I would like to order any interviews
of women aged 70 and over living alone. The topics of the
interviews are irrelevant.
This is, we suggest, a pragmatic approach that acknowledges
the need to balance burdens on depositors with demands for
exhaustive details of their primary research with making
more research data available in a timely manner.
The cases of reuse below, then, present a range of genres
of reuse. Some of the examples presented tend toward the
"context-rich" end of the continuum, with the secondary
researchers availing themselves of detailed knowledge of the
original data and project as well. However, other examples
show that even when relatively little contextual information
is available, secondary analysis can proceed with positive
results. To be absolutely clear, we do not want to overly
exaggerate this point--these cases vary on many dimen-
sions, not only context. And we would still encourage depos-
itors to include rich project descriptions, and those reusing
data to make use of any available materials. Our point is that
secondary analysis is, or should be, a broad church, and these
cases are useful for moving beyond abstract debate by show-
casing actual secondary research projects that can be assessed
on their own merits.
Connecting Qualitative and Quantitative Data
A number of qualitative reuse projects have drawn upon
related quantitative data. The studies below demonstrate dif-
ferent approaches to connecting qualitative secondary analysis
with survey data. Jane Gray's (2014) research examined chil-
dren in rural Irish communities during the first half of the 20th
century. Children's movement to and from school, and to non-
parental residences, was investigated using the Life Histories
and Social Change database held at the Irish Qualitative Data
Archive, which comprises 113 life stories, sampled from par-
ticipants in the nationally representative survey, Living in
Ireland. Because the interviews were selected from this larger,
quantitative survey, it permitted robust sampling by age (three
cohorts) and geography (urban/rural). Moreover, the in-depth
qualitative data made it possible to probe previous research
themes that claimed to have found evidence of "rural decay"
with young people leaving the countryside (Brody 1973). By
drawing upon the qualitative interview data, Gray found more
and stronger interconnections between households centered
on children. These ties worked to strengthen extended families
and promote social mobility of young people, moderating ear-
lier findings of rural decay.
Using a mixed-methods approach, Sarah Irwin (2011)
worked across qualitative and quantitative data by drawing
on data from the Longitudinal Study of Young People in
England and the Young Lives and Times study, qualitative
longitudinal data that are part of the Timescapes Study, to
address both methodological and substantive research ques-
tions. She used qualitative interview data to inform the
design of Young Lives and Times survey questions, and find-
ings from the Longitudinal Study ofYoung People in England
helped to shape interview questions asked in later phases of
qualitative longitudinal work. Finally, she situated partici-
pants in the qualitative sample in relation to characteristics of
the nationally representative sample. These strategies have
been highly successful in combining qualitative depth with
quantitative breadth.
Health
Broad topics with general appeal seem open to secondary
research; the field of health is an especially fertile domain.
An exemplary project was done by Stajduhar, Martin, and
Cairns (2010) on bereaved family caregivers and health care
providers supporting cancer patients. They reused data taken
from a larger mixed-methods study and conducted second-
ary analysis on the focus group data: three with bereaved
family caregivers, and two with health professionals. One
author had been involved with collecting the original data,
but the team also included new investigators who had not
been involved in the primary project. The team of secondary
researchers addressed new research questions, quite differ-
ent from those of the original study. Existing data were used
to identify factors that made grieving difficult for carers, for
example, carers may conceal the emotional toll of caregiv-
ing, and after a patient's death, and they lack the ability to
sustain social networks that could be supportive. The
research also revealed an ambivalent role for paid employ-
ment for carers: It could provide some support and structure,
but often, the stress of work simply compounded the burden
of caring responsibilities. Another study on bereavement by
Ribbens McCarthy (2006) drew on many sources such as
historical literature and also reused data from the Inventing
Adulthoods data collection (Henderson, Holland, Thomson,
McGrellis, & Sharpe, 2011).
One factor accounting for the abundance of secondary
analysis research in health is the availability of data. The
Health Experiences Research Group (2014) is located in the
Primary Care Health Sciences at University of Oxford and has
amassed one of the largest and best known repositories of
qualitative data about medical conditions at healthtalk.org. It
was established to conduct multi-disciplinary research on
health experiences and has compiled interviews with more
than 3,500 people about their experiences of more than 85
health-related issues. These data are being reused extensively.
Bishop and Kuula-Lummi 11
The substantial collection of data and the extensive net-
work of interested researchers have yielded diverse
approaches for primary and secondary analysts to work
together. For example, in Locock and Brown's (2010) work
on attitudes about support in motor neuron disease, the two
researchers pooled their data, in effect, both becoming sec-
ondary analysts of each other's data. Their method also
included joint development of coding categories for thematic
analysis. Ryan and Ziebland (2015) used data selected from
the collection to study the role of pets in peoples'experiences
of chronic illness, but neither had been involved in conduct-
ing the original interviews. Not only has this significant
repository supported diverse forms of collaboration, it has
also produced both theoretical and applied outputs. Published
articles cover a wide range of subjects and have appeared in
core medical journals, and other outputs and reports have
had direct policy relevance, such as improving understand-
ing of how people use the experiences of others to make their
own medical decisions and advice on end-of-life decision
making (General Medical Council, 2010).
Food
Food research is also well represented in qualitative secondary
analysis.Knight,Brannen,andO'Connell(2015)studiedfoodand
domestic life in England during 1950 by analyzing three diaries
written for the Mass Observation Archive. These narrative archi-
val sources offered a methodological alternative to traditional
research formats, such as interviews. In their case, the nature of
diaries offered not a "second-best" data source, but possibly one
preferable to direct interviews. The subject of food is sufficiently
morally freighted that direct questions often elicit normatively cor-
rect answers: "of course I eat five a day." It was thought the more
personal reflective diary format might reveal more authentic prac-
tices. In addition, the Mass Observation Archive provided an
ample supply of diaries from which to sample.
We decided to focus on the year 1950, for a number of reasons:
first, material from Mass Observation during the period of the
Second World War had already been extensively studied by
other researchers but the post-war period less so. Second, the
year 1950 was a particularly difficult time for ordinary people
with rising prices, including food, and the continuation of
rationing. Third, the Mass Observation Archive includes
directives from 1950, in which correspondents were asked for
their views on topics relevant to food, for example, on standards
of living, food costs, attitudes to continuing rationing and
housework tasks. We thought that this information could
usefully supplement and facilitate contextualisation of the diary
data. (Knight et al., 2015, par. 2.7)
Family Practices
The particular suitability of existing data is also a feature of
research on family practices. As with food, everyday family
practices can go unremarked, and are often not recalled
because they are--consciously or not--regarded as insignifi-
cant. Phoenix and Brannen (2014) each revisited their own
data that had originally been collected for different purposes.
They then collaborated to use the narrative data that had been
produced in the original projects to investigate family expe-
riences of fatherhood and of children as language brokers for
their families.
Motherhood as well as fatherhood has proved a rich object
for reuse studies. In Thomson, Moe, Thorne, and Bjerrum-
Nielsen (2012), the original empirical materials were pro-
duced in an earlier study about motherhood. A researcher
made weekly visits to observe interactions between one
young mother and her baby, with highly detailed notes made
after each visit, ranging from bodily movements and vocal-
izations to notes about the home environment. More than
five years later, a new team assembled, including the original
observer and others from the primary team, with several new
researchers to embark on an intensive study of this single
case using psycho-social techniques of close reading of these
texts. In intensive group sessions, which included reading
the original notes aloud, the team concurred that key pas-
sages conveyed strong affect (e.g., the baby described as
very "demanding" about feeding), and these corresponded
with passages that had been noted by the original observers,
suggesting that even something as subtle as "affect" can be
captured in transcribed notes. The highly detailed original
observational notes, the presence of the original observer in
the new team, and the psycho-social method that focused on
both manifest and latent meanings in the data as well as the
(relatively) slow pace of the reanalysis all combined to help
mitigate one of the most frequent criticisms of secondary
analysis: absence of the context of the original study.
In a final example, Meg Wiggins followed up with some of
the mothers from Ann Oakley's (1979) Becoming a Mother
project to interview them about their reflections on mother-
hood 35 years after they had given birth. It is a methodologi-
cally impressive project, both for successfully locating the
mothers after so long a time period and the innovative blend-
ing of expertise, with Oakley assisting in the research, and
Wiggins in the leading role in the secondary project. Wiggins
was able to secure consent from many participants and suc-
cessfully archived interviews from the follow-up study
(Wiggins, 2015).
At the UK Data Service, the largest qualitative data set,
almost 500 long interview transcripts and audio from the study,
Family Life and Work Experience Before 1918, 1870-1973,
known as The Edwardians have been available to users since
1972, and in a digital version from 2009 (Thompson & Lummis,
2009). The study is unique, not only as it enabled Thompson to
pioneer his Life History method, but also in its extensive cover-
age of content providing researchers with a wide range of topics
to investigate about working class life in the Edwardian period:
issues on domestic routine, household roles, meals, the upbring-
ing of children, emotional relationships and values in the family,
12 SAGE Open
leisure, religion, politics, school, courtship and marriage,
extended family, relationships with neighbors, experience of
work, and occupational history of the whole family. The avail-
able data have resulted in hundreds of reuse publications written
predominantly by social historians and sociologists.
Work
Sometimes, the discovery of data from an earlier research
study borders on the marvelous. In 2000, data from a study
about young workers in Leicester conducted by Norbert
Elias in the early 1960s were discovered in boxes stored in an
attic. In the boxes were 894 original interview schedules,
along with letters, memos, and other notes and supporting
materials. In the world of data archiving, this constitutes pure
gold. Two researchers, O'Connor and Goodwin (2010),
began a project of two phases, first to examine the recovered
data, and second to retrace and reinterview a sub-sample of
the original respondents. About 500 respondents had indi-
cated on the original questionnaire that they were willing to
be contacted for subsequent research. Using many search
strategies, 157 were located and 97 agreed to be reinter-
viewed, an extraordinary success given that nearly four
decades had elapsed. This case illustrates the immense
potential of qualitative longitudinal research, and impor-
tantly, it represents the genre of research where the analysts
of secondary data proceed without assistance from, or even
contact with, the original investigator. The prevalence of
diverse configurations of teams composed of primary and
secondary collaborators should not detract from the demon-
strated viability of researchers coming fresh to newly discov-
ered data.
In Finland, work has also been a frequent topic of second-
ary analysis. Finns love to write, and as such, humanities and
social science researchers collect written contributions by
organizing writing competitions or by publishing requests in
the press asking people to write about certain issues and
experiences. One example of data collected in this in way is
the data set now archived at FSD titled, Stories about Fear
and Intimidation at Work 2008-2009, that consists of 102
written stories of approximately 500 pages (Eriksson, Koski,
Luomanen, & Parviainen, 2011). The data were collected as
part of the Leadership, Power and Fear (LEAR) research
project at the University of Tampere via an online research
platform in June 2008 that invited volunteers to write narra-
tives about their experiences following a set of guidelines
(Luomanen, 2009). Respondents provided essential back-
ground variables such as gender, education, age, the branch
and size of their organization, and position at work at the
time. They were asked to describe intimidation events, what
they had been afraid of and why, what had led to the situa-
tion, and how they had been intimidated. The writers were
also invited to describe situations where they themselves had
resorted to intimidation at work and what the consequences
had been.
The final LEAR project data set did not need to be anony-
mized by archivists. Not only was the background informa-
tion collected using predefined codes, the writers were
instructed to tell the story without mentioning the proper
names of people or organizations they referred to. This "self-
anonymising" aspect suggests that projects are increasingly
planned with reuse in mind and that respondents can be
asked and trusted to take on some of these responsibilities for
ethical data sharing. The resulting stories can still be told in
a vivid and captivating way.
This data set has been reused for 29 different reuse pur-
poses,includingsevenpublishedmasters'theses.Researchers
are studying various aspects of working life, and they use the
data set to get ideas for refining their research questions, to
plan new data collection, or to compare with their own data.
Summary of Reuse Case Studies
It has proven challenging to determine what features make
data collections amenable to reuse, but the cases presented
here present some clues. For teaching, some features have
been noted above: collections with multiple types of data,
data relevant to current policy debates, and topics of interest
to young people. The research cases presented display some
of these same features and also suggest that detailed data on
broad topics such as health, family, food, work, and poverty
make qualitative data appealing for secondary analysis.
Intriguingly, it may be that when the topic of interest for
reuse was not central in the original research that the primary
data may have the greatest reuse potential. This is particu-
larly true when it may be difficult to elicit direct responses
because the topic is sensitive (health), morally laden (food),
or taken for granted (family practices).
Conclusion
Are we in any better position in 2016 to assess the state of
secondary analysis of qualitative data? In some regards, we
believe the answer is yes. Data policy requirements are
diverse, and infrastructures are varied; however, expecta-
tions in the United Kingdom are shifting: Twenty years ago,
most researchers would not have even considered sharing
qualitative data; now, at least in the United Kingdom, there is
a growing belief that much data can be shared and reused,
and exceptions need to be well justified. Significantly, there
is institutional support and funding for reusing qualitative
data: the Economic and Social Research Council's (2016)
Secondary Data Analysis Initiative includes qualitative data
in its list of eligible resources. Whereas this is the case in the
United Kingdom, it is still far from the situation elsewhere,
even in countries such as Finland.
Although evidence presented here is partial, there are
multiple indicators of growing reuse and the presence of the
approach in highly regarded research methods events and
publications further confirms that finding. We also know
Bishop and Kuula-Lummi 13
that three-fifths of the data collections (in scope and ana-
lyzed in this work) at the UK Data Service are used, that
teaching and learning are the primary purposes of reuse,
and that usage is increasing reasonably steadily. In addi-
tion, the cases presented above on health, food, family,
work, and poverty are just that, selected exemplary cases.
There is further evidence of expanding reuse of qualitative
data, sometimes across entire disciplines. In the United
States, Elman et al. (2010) describe what they call a "renais-
sance" in qualitative research methods in political science,
citing a proliferation of articles, books, and courses.
What we find most exciting, and encouraging, is the
diversity of models developing even within the genre of
secondary analysis. In so many instances, data reuse prac-
tices are emerging to enhance methodological robustness,
for example, by combining the breadth of quantitative
scope with the depth of qualitative insight. The reuse of
data from especially hard-to-reach or vulnerable respon-
dents--notably for teaching in the health area--gives stu-
dents opportunities to work with rare data while
minimizing patient burden. As for the context debate,
more may be good, but there is no doubt that researchers
find ways (as historians have long done) to use rich
sources when available, yet still proceed carefully and
creatively when they are absent. And finally, examples of
data from studies done decades ago prove that even when
collaborations with the primary researchers are impossi-
ble, data from the past can still yield rich, relevant research
outcomes.
