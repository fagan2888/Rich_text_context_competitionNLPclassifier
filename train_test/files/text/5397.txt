Although most universal school-based prevention programs
target students aged 6 to 13 (Foxcroft & Tsertsvadze, 2011;
Thomas & Perera, 2006), fewer programs have been designed
for the crucial phases of mid- to post-adolescence. Some pro-
grams focus on substance use, whereas others consider a
larger set of psychosocial variables, such as life skills or mul-
tiple problem behaviors (Botvin, Griffin, Paul, & Macaulay,
2003). Existing programs only aiming to reduce older ado-
lescents' consumption of psychoactive substances have so
far been shown to be less effective than interventions for
younger students (Foxcroft & Tsertsvadze, 2011; Malwald &
Reese, 2000; Thomas & Perera, 2006; Tobler et al., 2000).
Positive effects shown in meta-analyses included a decrease
in frequency of drunkenness and "binge drinking" in the age
group of 13 years and younger (Botvin et al., 2003; Faggiano
et al., 2005; Poduska et al., 2008). Still, the development of
interventions for older adolescents is desirable, because the
readiness for experimentation, risk taking, and related social
costs increase at this age.
Concepts and Challenges in Promoting
Risk Competence
The life skills program REBOUND targets the age group of
14- to 25-year-olds. REBOUND aims at providing primary
prevention for non-consumers as well as secondary preven-
tion for consumers. To achieve this goal, REBOUND focuses

Pilot Evaluation Study of the Life
Skills Program REBOUND: Effects
on Substance Use, Knowledge About
Substances, and Risk Perception
Henrik Jungaberle1,2 and Ede Nagy1
Abstract
The main aim of the study is pilot evaluation of the life skills program REBOUND in a school context focusing on substance
use, risk perception, and knowledge about psychoactive substances ( nIG CG
+ = 723 students in five schools and 46 classes,
M
age
= 14.8, range 14-18) for the total sample and in the subgroups gender, age, and school type. Main goal of the study is
collecting evidence for program optimization. A controlled study was carried out with repeated measurement before and
after the intervention (4-6 months). Multilevel analyses, ANCOVA, and logistic regression analyses were applied to measure
the effects. Overall, significantly lower incidence rates of drunkenness (odds ratio [OR] = .55; p = .033), improved knowledge
about psychoactive substances (p = .006), lower personal (p = .013) and general tobacco risk perception among users
(p = .002), and lower general tobacco (p = .018) and cannabis (p = .000) risk perception in non-users were found in the total
intervention group. In subgroups, significantly lower rates for the incidence of drunkenness can be shown for males (p =
.008) and for younger participants (p = .004). Students at academic high school (German Gymnasium) showed a decrease in
30-day prevalence for alcohol (p = .017) and cannabis (p = .014), and they improved in their knowledge about psychoactive
substances (p = .000). In vocational high school classes (German Realschule), there was an increase in the relative alcohol risk
perception of the students (p = .019). REBOUND contributes to a controlled use of alcohol and increases knowledge about
psychoactive substances. REBOUND has various effects on the examined subgroups age, gender, and school type: Males,
younger students, and students in academic high school benefitted more from the course regarding consumption-related
criteria. We suggest a program optimization specific to school form and age, inclusion of a tobacco intervention, and the use
of more gender-segregated interventions.

on the promotion of life skills and risk competence
(Fahrenkrug, 1998; Franzkowiak, 1996; Löwe, Braun, &
Kisser, 2008) in the consumption of alcohol and other drugs.
Risk competence is a life skill and as such is important in
preventing and reducing maladaptive coping strategies
known to be a major factor in developing addiction (Jessor &
Jessor, 1977; Lazarus & Folkman, 1984; Resch, 1999;
Silbereisen & Reese, 2001). It is a self-regulative strategy
sensu Bandura (2005) and can be seen as a part of health
behavior (Ajzen, 1991; Becker, 1974).
Four dimensions were hypothesized as constituting risk
competence: (a) self-reflection and risk reflection, (b) verifi-
able knowledge about psychoactive substances and their use,
(c) control, that is, the intention to and success with limiting
one's use, and (d) an orientation toward positive goals in the
future that exclude destructive substance use.
Challenges for the promotion of risk competence are for
example delaying the onset of use, which is an important pre-
dictor for later addiction (Chou & Pickering, 1992; Laucht &
Schmid, 2007; Lynskey et al., 2003; Robins & Przybeck,
1985). Others are the heterogeneous consumption habits at
this age, differences in gender, and school-form consumption
patterns that need to be considered for intervention and call
for the analysis of subgroups in evaluation (Rothwell, 2005).
For example, male gender is associated with higher con-
sumption of psychoactive substances (Kulis, Yabiku,
Marsiglia, Nieri, & Crossman, 2007; Lev-Ran, Le Strat,
Imtiaz, Rehm, & Le Foll, 2013; van Etten & Anthony, 2001).
The participants of the present study were from voca-
tional high school (Realschule) and academic high school
(Gymnasium). Studies have shown different prevalences of
substance use at different types of schools (Bundeszentrale
für gesundheitliche Aufklärung, 2012; O'Malley, Johnston,
Bachman, Schulenberg, & Kumar, 2006).
Hypotheses
We assume that the participation in REBOUND has a posi-
tive effect on risk competence that will lead to no or a
decreased consumption of alcohol, tobacco, and cannabis;
promote adequate risk perception; and increase participants'
knowledge about psychoactive substances. In addition, we
examine whether the reported effects in predefined sub-
groups hold for REBOUND; that is, participants benefit
more from the program, when they are younger, female, and
students at academic high school.
Method
Study Design and Setting
A controlled study with repeated measurements was con-
ducted in southern Germany from September 2011 to July
2012. In this naturalistic field study, the intervention group
(IG) consisted of school classes (ninth and 10th graders)
taking part in the program over a period of 4 to 5 months.
The control group (CG) consisted of classes of the same age
group. Twenty-nine course instructors were trained for the
pilot phase and implemented the program for their first time.
Due to the number of participating schools in the program's
developmental phase, randomization in this quasi-experi-
mental design was conducted by classrooms, rather than by
the low number of schools in the development phase and did
not succeed in all cases, due to the practical fact that some
schools were not able to adjust their class schedules in such
a way that the REBOUND teachers could be assigned to the
randomized classes. Blind randomization was not possible
because students, parents, and trainers would know which
group participated in REBOUND and which did not.
The survey was conducted online using EFS-Survey 8.1
(Décieux, Heinz, & Jacob, 2011). It took place within 1 week
before and after the intervention (M processing time 29 min;
SD = 6.6). Response to all questions was mandatory with the
exception of irrelevant subordinate questions.
Intervention
The 16 units of REBOUND were integrated into school cur-
ricula and taught in weekly sessions of 90 min. The sessions
were facilitated by trained course instructors teaching at the
participating school. They were optionally assisted by peer
mentors. The intervention is described in detail in Kröninger-
Jungaberle, Nagy, von Heyden, DuBois, and the REBOUND
Participative Development Group (2014).
REBOUND integrates best-practice elements, such as
promotion of life skills, information about psychoactive sub-
stances, the use of peer mentoring, and normative education
(Cujpers, 2002; Hawks & Scott, 2002; Tobler, et al., 2000).
In addition, its developers created innovative methods, most
notably "explorative film work" consisting of joint scenario
analysis of videos depicting risk behaviors in realistic con-
text. The latter is based on Bandura's (2005) self-regulation
approach and aims to enhance cooperation and risk assess-
ment among students. In the course of the sessions, health-
promoting norms are identified by reflecting healthy and
harmful cognitive­emotive and behavioral patterns. For
example, the classroom would frequently talk about the abil-
ity to take a conscious break from weekly alcohol consump-
tion or the necessity of training general self-control, body
awareness, and peer-pressure resistance skills, if thinking
about trying a psychoactive substance.
Measures
Our large questionnaire contained five different groups of
items relating to socio-demographic variables, substance
use, risk perception, knowledge about psychoactive sub-
stances, and possible confounding covariates.
The following socio-demographic variables were collected:
schooltype,gender,age,housing,familysetting,pocket money,
Jungaberle and Nagy 3
parents' occupation, recreational activities, and satisfaction
with school performance. Satisfaction with school perfor-
mance was measured using a 7-point Likert-type scale rang-
ing from 1 = not at all satisfied to 7 = very satisfied.
The frequency of alcohol, tobacco, and cannabis use was
measured by lifetime, 6-month-, and 30-day prevalence. The
information concerning the 6-month prevalence was gath-
ered using a 7-point Likert-type scale ranging from 0 = not at
all to 6 = 40 times or more. Thirty-day prevalence was equiv-
alent to the number of consumption days in a month (0 to
31). In addition, frequency of drunkenness and binge drink-
ing were ascertained for the last month. Binge drinking was
defined as the consumption of at least five alcoholic drinks
on one occasion. Finally, the intensity of last alcohol intoxi-
cation was measured on a 7-point Likert-type scale ranging
from 1 = only slightly tipsy to 7 = so drunk that I could hardly
remain standing on my feet. The items were adapted from a
survey among 12- to 25-year-olds in Germany conducted by
the Federal Centre for Health Education (Bundeszentrale für
gesundheitliche Aufklärung, 2012).
Three different kinds of risk perception were measured:
the general--"how risky is it for everybody?" personal--
"how risky is it for me?" and relative--"how risky is it for me
compared with for other people?" These were assessed for
use of alcohol, tobacco, and cannabis. We also asked non-
consumers about their perception of the risk for the general
population. All were done using a 7-point Likert-type scale
from 1 = harmless to 7 = very dangerous.
We developed a 40-item test to assess knowledge about
alcohol, tobacco, cannabis, and psychoactive substances in
general with 10 items for each category (e.g., nicotine improves
concentration and short term memory; answers given as true,"
not true, do not know). The do not know answers were counted
as wrong answers. Cronbach's alpha for the total scale was .80
before and .85 after the intervention.
The following covariates were measured on a 5-point
Likert-type scale from 1 = not at all true to 5 = absolutely
true: normality of the consumption of alcohol, tobacco, and
cannabis in the peer group (e.g., drinking of alcohol is com-
pletely normal in my peer group), parental acceptance of
one's own use of alcohol, tobacco, and cannabis (e.g., for my
parents, it's ok, if I smoke), not being liked by peers (I am not
liked by other kids), being bullied (other students often make
fun of me), behavioral problems in school (I have had fre-
quent problems in the school, e.g., fighting, disturbing the
lesson), perceived bio-psycho-social stress (compared with
other people my family and I have more problems such as
divorce, illness, financial problems), and the perceived rela-
tionship with parents (in general, I have a good relationship
with my parents).
Study Sample
We were able to include 1,148 students in 48 school classes in
five schools in the quasi-experimental design. Twenty-three
students chose not to participate. IG: n = 679 students in 29
school classes, CG: n = 446 students in 19 school classes.
The sample was constituted by students of academic and
vocational high schools; other German school types were
underrepresented (n = 16 students) and therefore excluded.
The quasi-experimental design resulted in a lack of equiva-
lence between IG and CG regarding a number of variables.
Hence, propensity score matching (Rosenbaum & Rubin,
1983) was carried out to achieve equivalence between IG and
CG, using the "nearest" algorithm of the R-package "MatchIt"
within the framework of the statistical software R.2.15.2 (Ho,
Imai, King, & Stuart, 2011). This achieved equivalence on all
test variables except "amount of pocket money a month"
( MIG = 32.2 Euro, MCG = 26.9 Euro; T = -2.49, p = .013; see
Table 1). Due to the matching procedure, the sample decreased
by 126 persons (11.8% of the total sample) and two classes.
The analyzed sample became after Attrition as follows: n =
723, 48.1% male, 51.9% female, M age: 14.8 years (median =
15; SD = .74, range = 14-17), school type: vocational high
school: 48.7%, academic high school: 51.3% (see Figure 1).
Multilevel structure.The data have a hierarchical structure
(Level 1 = students, Level 2 = classes). Because of the similar
context, higher correlations within the classes were expected
than between them (intraclass correlation coefficient [ICC] ).
Therefore, at first, the ICC of the study variables (difference
values between the pre- and post-measurements: T2-T1) was
computed. This procedure was necessary to calculate the design
effects (DE), so that the appropriate analytical methods could be
determined (conventional vs. multilevel analyses). DE is a func-
tion of the ICC and the average cluster size (m), which allows
adjusting the sample size at excessive ICC. DE is calculated
according to the formula 1 + (m - 1) × p. In the case of a DE >
2, the application of a multilevel analysis is recommended (B.
O. Muthén & Satorra, 1995). In addition, determining the ICC
was necessary for the post hoc calculation of the discoverable
effect sizes for hierarchical data. For two covariates and five
dependent variables, DE > 2 was found.The rest of the variables
yielded an average ICC after Fisher's Z transformation of .024
(min: .00, max: .066). The ICC and DE are shown in Tables 2
and 3 in the two columns on the right side.
Control of Covariates
To statistically control the influence of covariates on the rela-
tionship between group membership and intervention effects,
covariates were selected that showed a high correlation with
at least three of the dependent variables, but low correlations
among each other.
These conditions were met by the following 11 variables,
which were subsequently used as covariates: type of school
(due to no variance at the cluster level not used in multilevel
regression analysis [MLA]), gender, traditional family set-
ting (living with both biological parents), high socioeco-
nomic status, satisfaction with school performance, leisure

activities, normality of tobacco use among friends (due to
DE > 2 used only in MLA), being bullied, behavioral prob-
lems in school, and perceived bio-psycho-social stress level.
For the subgroup analyses with a reduced number of vari-
ables, the eligibility conditions were met by the following
four variables: higher status parental occupation, normality of
cannabis use among peers, parental acceptance of students'
tobacco use, and leisure activities in disco, bar, or café.
Data Analysis
Total sample analysis.Because of the nested data structure,
MLAs (analysis type = two level) were applied using the
software Mplus 5.21 (L. K. Muthén & Muthén, 1998) for the
analysis of intervention effects on the five dependent vari-
ables (DV) with DE > 2. For each DV, a difference value of
pre- and post-measurement was calculated to reflect the indi-
vidual change in the outcome variables. In the MLA, a fixed-
effect model was used with a dummy-coded predictor
(group) and random intercept specified for each DV. The
influence of covariates was statistically controlled in the
model.
For dependent variables with a DE < 2, we applied univari-
ate analyses of covariance and logistic regression analyses
using SPSS 0.20. Logistic regression analyses including group
as the predictor and the covariates were used for the analysis of
intervention effects on the incidence rates of alcohol, tobacco,
cannabis, and drunkenness. The intervention effects on the
pre­post difference values of continuously scaled variables
were examined using fixed-factor group ANCOVAs.
Subgroup analyses. The sample was divided into subgroups:
gender, age (aggregated samples of 14- to 15-year-olds and
16- to 17-year-olds), and school type (vocational and aca-
demic high school). Alpha error accumulation in multiple
tests was countered by reducing the number of consumption
variables. The 30-day prevalence of alcohol, tobacco, and
cannabis use and the lifetime prevalence of drunkenness
were included in the analyses.
The following variables did not show equivalence
between IG and CG before the course (T1) and were excluded:
30-day prevalence of alcohol in the subgroup of vocational
high school students ( MIG = 1.93, MCG = 2.99, t = 2.45,
df = 174.5, p = .015), lifetime prevalence of drunkenness
( rateIG = 44.4%, rateCG = 30%, 2 = 4.42, df = 1, p = .035),
and 30-day prevalence of tobacco use in the subgroup of aca-
demic high school students ( MIG = 1.53, MCG = .64, t =
-2.1, df = 281.6, p = .03); personal alcohol risk perception in
the subgroup of males ( MIG = 2.03, MCG = 2.51, t = 2.43, df
= 130.15, p = .016), relative alcohol risk perception in the age
group of 14 to 15 years old ( MIG = 2.07, MCG = 2.35, t =
2.03, df = 429, p = .043), overall alcohol risk perception in
non-drug users ( MIG = 4.73, MCG = 5.75, t = 3.02, df = 21,
p = .007), and general cannabis risk perception in drug users
( MIG = 3.85, MCG = 6.00, t = 3.19, df = 15.92, p = .006) in
the age group of 16- to 17-year-olds.

Only those subgroups are suitable for analysis in which
significant interaction effects can be found (Brookes et al.,
2001). First, interaction effects were examined between gen-
der, age, and school type as well as between membership in
the IG and CG. ANOVAs and logistic regression analyses
were conducted.
Some variables were dichotomous such as "drunkenness"
(yes/no). The incidence rate of these was calculated using
logistic regression analyses. Again, we controlled for the
influence of the four covariates. In each subgroup, seven
tests were carried out, which contributed to the accumulation
of the alpha error. Thus, sequential Bonferroni correction
sensu Holm (1979) was used, which is less conservative than
the usual Bonferroni correction.
Results
Attrition
Of the total sample (N = 2,153 pre- and post data sets in the
IG and CG), 709 (36 %) student data sets were missing
( nIG = 284; 21.7%; nCG = 425; 50.2%). From these, 15.3%
were caused by having no match between pre- and post-data
due to absent or deviant identification codes. In all, 5.9%

were missing due to response bias (e.g., processing time less
than 10 min, response tendencies) and implausible responses
(pocket money, for example, 9,999 Euros). Finally, 11.7%
were excluded by the propensity score matching. There was
evidence of systematic dropout comparing the analysis sam-
ple (N = 854) with the dropout sample (N = 276). Students

Results in the Total Sample
Sensitivity analyses. The calculation of effect sizes for hierar-
chical data with the five dependent variables with a DE > 2
was carried out using Optimal Design V.2.0 (Raudenbush,
2011). For the 46 classrooms with an average cluster size of
15.72, 1 -  = .80,  = .05 and  = .11, a detectable effects
size of d > .35 was calculated.
The sensitivity for non-hierarchical data was computed
using the software G-Power (Faul, Erdfelder, Lang, &
Buchner, 2007). Detectable effect sizes of d > .15 were found
for ANCOVA with n = 723, two groups (df = 1), 10 covari-
ates, 1 -  = .80, and  = .05. For the logistic regression
analysis with odds ratio (OR) = .55 (drunkenness) and OR =
.55 (traditional family setting), a power of 1 -  > .94 was
calculated (two tailed), Pr(Y = 1/X = 0), H0 = 0.5 1,  = .05,
n = 723, Rother X

Substance use, risk perception, and knowledge about psychoac-
tive substances. Results of the multilevel regression analysis
are shown in Table 2. Significant regression weights were
found while controlling for covariates in the dependent vari-
ables general risk perception of tobacco use for users (B =
-.647, p = .02) and knowledge about psychoactive sub-
stances (B = 1.336, p = .006).The participation in REBOUND
was associated with a significant decrease in general risk
perception of tobacco use for smokers but remained on a
high level (4.9 on a 7-point scale) and resulted in a highly
significant increase in knowledge about psychoactive sub-
stances (see Table 3 for the results of the ANCOVAs).
The adjusted mean difference (AMD) provides informa-
tion about the difference between the mean values in the IG
and CG (comparisons of main effects were Bonferroni-
adjusted). Based on the adjusted effect sizes (partial 2) of
the predictor group, effect sizes f were calculated. A signifi-
cant influence of the predictor group was found regarding the
T2 - T1 difference values of the DV for personal risk per-
ception of tobacco use for users (AMD = -.85, F = 6.28,
df = 1, p = .018, f = .14) and general risk perception of
tobacco use (AMD = -.33, F = 5.6, df = 1, p = .018, f = .14),
and cannabis use for non-users (AMD = -.54, F = 13.18,
df = 1, p = .000, f = .16).
These results indicate that after participating in
REBOUND, users of tobacco rated their tobacco consump-
tion as less dangerous than tobacco users in the CG. In addi-
tion, non-user in the IG compared with the non-user in the
CG showed a decrease in general risk perception of tobacco
and cannabis.
Incidence rates. The results of the logistic regression analyses
are shown in Table 4. The best model fit was found by the
Hosmer­Lemeshow global model fit tests on the DV inci-
dence of cannabis use and incidence of drunkenness.
Although the best fit (Nagelkerke pseudo-R2) was found for
the DV incidence of cannabis use, the contribution of the
predictor group was not significant (Wald test). However, the
Wald test was significant for the predictor group for the DV
incidence of drunkenness. Students in the IG had a decreased
risk of initiating first drunkenness compared with the CG
(OR = .55; 95% confidence interval [CI] = [.32, .95]).
Using logistic regression, traditional family setting sig-
nificantly predicted the incidence of drunkenness (Wald =
3.9, df = 1, OR = .55, 95% CI = [.3, .99], p = .048). The prob-
ability for initiating first drunkenness in students who live
with their two biological parents is .55 times larger. All sig-
nificant results in the total sample are shown in Figure 2.

Results in the Subgroups
Sensitivity analyses. The results of the ANCOVA and logistic
regression analyses are presented in Table 5 and Figure 3 for
all subgroups. Due to the formation of subgroups with
smaller sample sizes, a decrease of statistical power is to be
expected (Kleist, 2007). To determine the discoverable effect
sizes in the subgroup analyses, sensitivity analyses (Faul,
et al., 2007) were conducted. Detectable effect sizes of d >
.146 were calculated for the subgroup of students at academic
high school (ANCOVA with two groups (df = 1), four covari-
ates, 1 ­  = .80, and  = .05. The detectable effect sizes for
students at vocational high schools were d > .51. For the sub-
groups of boys and the age group of 14- to 15-year-olds, a
statistical power of 1 -  > .88 was calculated (two tailed),

with OR = .37 (incidence of drunkenness in boys) and OR =

Interactions.Regarding the IG/CG and the subgroups, the
following interactions were found with regard to the study
variables: gender by group for the dependent variable drunk-
enness incidence (Wald = 3.99, df = 1, OR = .74, 95% CI =
[.54, .99], p = .044), school type by group for the dependent
variable drunkenness incidence (Wald = 7.97, df = 1, OR =
.76, 95% CI = [.63, .92], p = .05), 30-day alcohol use preva-
lence (F = 16.31, df = 1, p = .000), 30-day tobacco use preva-
lence (F = 6.29, df = 1, p = .013), 30 days' cannabis use
prevalence (F = 9.3, df = 1, p = .03), relative alcohol risk
perception (F = 5.76, df = 1, p = .17), and age group by group
for the dependent variable drunkenness incidence (Wald =
3.99, df = 1, OR = .34, 95% CI = [.54, .99], p = .46).
Gender. A significant result in the subgroup gender was found
for the incidence of drunkenness for boys (Wald = 7.1, df = 1,
OR = .37, 95% CI = [.18, .77], p = .008). The probability for
an initiation of the first drunkenness for boys in the interven-
tion group is 0.37 times higher than in the control group.

School type.The highest number of significant intervention
effects was found in the subgroup of academic high school
students. After the course, students in the intervention group
consumed significantly less alcohol (F = 1.44, df = 1, p =
.017) and less cannabis (F = 6.83, df = 1, p = .014) in the past
30 days, and knew more about psychoactive substances (F =
12.95, df = 1, p = .000). Participants of REBOUND in voca-
tional high schools reported a higher relative risk perception
of alcohol than the control group (F = 5.571, df = 1, p = .019).
Age groups. The younger REBOUND participants (age group
of 14 to 15 years) showed a significantly lower incidence of
drunkenness (Wald = 8.1, df = 1, OR = .44, 95% CI = [.25,
.77], p = .004). The probability for initiating first drunken-
ness was 0.44 times higher than in the control group.
Discussion
Summary of Results
The present study examined effects of the life skills and risk
education program REBOUND on substance use, risk per-
ception, and knowledge about psychoactive substances. The
total sample and the subgroups gender, age, and school types
were examined.
In the total sample, fewer students initiated first drunken-
ness compared with controls. The decreased initiation of
drunkenness directly after the course can be interpreted as a
first indication of risk competent dealing with alcohol and
not just a change of cognitions. Similar effects were found
previously in life-skills programs (Botvin, et al., 2003;
Faggiano, et al., 2005; Poduska, et al., 2008).
After the course, the personal risk perception in smokers
and the general tobacco and cannabis risk perception in non-
users decreased, but remained on a high level. However, no
increase in the incidence of tobacco or cannabis consumption
was found, although the average age of onset in tobacco con-
sumptioninGermanycurrentlyisat14.3years(Bundeszentrale
für gesundheitliche Aufklärung, 2012); this is when the
course starts. This decrease in risk perception could be inter-
preted as iatrogenic effect, which would need to be cared for
in a program revision. The alternative view is seeing it as a
desirable reduction in unrealistic high-risk perception (pre-
sumably acquired through scare tactics). Such a dispropor-
tionate risk perception may trigger a trivialization of risks
when actually being confronted with the reality of drug use
(see switching-risk effect; Zwick, 2005). This is particularly
true for cannabis with its polarized public image. Given the
political changes in cannabis politics, further research is
needed to determine such effects. In providing science-based
trustworthy and balanced information, REBOUND supports
an autonomous and more adequate assessment of risks in this
age group.
Subgroup analyses showed that male students in the inter-
vention group were less likely to initiate first drunkenness.
This indicates increased risk competence with regard to the
control of alcohol. Because the risk for alcohol-related prob-
lems in males is generally increased (Lev-Ran, et al., 2013),
this finding represents an important component of the effec-
tiveness of REBOUND. The program also had a stronger
influence on the consumption behavior of academic high
school students (Gymnasium) compared with vocational
high school students: The 30-day prevalence was reduced for
both alcohol and cannabis use in this school type.
Students in academic high school after the course show
increased substance knowledge, indicating better handling of
objectively verifiable information. This education bias con-
firms findings in previous studies showing that students with
stronger cognitive and linguistic capacities benefit more
from prevention courses (e.g., O'Malley et al., 2006).
In vocational high school, REBOUND contributed to
increasing the relative alcohol risk perception, suggesting a
reduction of the self-serving bias (underestimation of one's
own vulnerability compared with others; Weinstein, 1980)
and indicating an increase in critical reflection and success-
ful risk pedagogy.
After the course, the subgroup of younger participants
(14- to 15-year-olds) had a lower incidence of initiating
drunkenness. This is a favorable effect considering the
increased risk of a pathological development connected with
early onset of alcohol consumption (Chou & Pickering,
1992; Laucht & Schmid, 2007; Lynskey, et al., 2003; Robins
& Przybeck, 1985).
The results of the subgroup analyses allow for a more pre-
cise interpretation of the findings in the total sample. The
increase of knowledge in the total sample predominantly
originates from the participants in academic high school, and
the decline in incidence of drunkenness is due to the younger
and male course participants.
Methodological Strengths and Weaknesses of the
Study
The methodological strengths of the study are the multilevel
analyses, the propensity score matching, and the control of
covariates. These strengths can counteract the disadvantages
of the study design. In this first evaluation of REBOUND,
only a small number of schools participated. This weakness,
as well as school internal organizational issues, made only a
partial randomization at the class level possible. Due to this
pilot design, a spillover effect could have happened
(Angelucci & Di Maro, 2015), that is, a possible exchange of
the course content between IG and CG, and was not con-
trolled for. Randomization problems are well known regard-
ing educational settings. Due to the small sample size and the
strong dropout, only small effects (0.10 < f < 0.24) could be
found. More students with consumption experiences dropped
out from the CG or were excluded in the matching proce-
dure. Parts of the systematic dropout can be explained by low
12 SAGE Open
compliance of those students who did not participate in the
course.
Strengths of the subgroup analyses are the examination of
the interactions between subgroups and intervention in rela-
tion to the dependent variables, the statistical controlling of
the influence of covariates, and the Bonferroni­Holm adjust-
ment. The sample equivalence was checked for all study
variables, and intervention effects were examined only for
those variables for which no differences between IG and CG
were found before the course. This meant only a few crite-
rion variables could be examined.
Conclusion and Practical Implications
There is a need for life skills programs that include substance
use addressing young people in late adolescence and early
adulthood (Foxcroft & Tsertsvadze, 2011; Thomas & Perera,
2006; Tobler, et al., 2000). In this phase, universal school-
based programs typically are working with inhomogeneous
groups with significant differences regarding resilience and
risk behaviors.
Conceptually, the program is geared toward medium-
(after 2 years) and long-term (over 5 years) self-regulation
(Bandura, 2005). First improvements of risk competence were
found concerning knowledge and initiation of drunkenness in
the total sample; in subgroups, frequency of cannabis use was
reduced. The negative effects on risk perception occurred with
no negative effects on consumption measured after the course.
REBOUND intends to stimulate a qualitative change of func-
tions and social contexts of consumption (Franzkowiak, 2001;
Koller, 2004), which has yet to be proved. Long-term effects
of REBOUND as well as the long-term impact of the mea-
sured risk perception changes should be analyzed in follow-up
studies. Future evaluation with a larger school sample should
include program effects on life skills and resilience variables.
Teacher and parent outcomes should be added.
Risk education components of the program should more
intensely consider the issue of tobacco use (Faggiano, et al.,
2005), which is also strongly related to the consumption of
cannabis (Fahrenkrug, 1998).
The first REBOUND program evaluation shows encour-
aging results for prevention programs that are risk compe-
tence­based and not grounded on scare tactics or abstinence
orientation. The results as well as an analysis of a large quali-
tative data set also provided information for the adaptation
and improvement of the program to version 1.0 in 2014.
REBOUND is now ready for a new randomized controlled
trial (RCT) study and a multimethod evaluation of long-term
effects. It is a promising self-regulation and risk competence
program for age groups starting at 14 years which are
engaged in multiple risk behaviors.
