Introduction
Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is an endocrine disor-
der affecting 6­8
per cent of adult females (Himelein and
Thatcher, 2006). Women with PCOS experience many
symptoms including hirsutism (Keegan et al., 2003), obe-
sity, acne, alopecia and menstrual irregularities (Rasgon
et al., 2003). Women with PCOS can suffer from more than
one condition, including type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular
disease (Ong et al., 2006; Thomson et al., 2010), irritable
bowel syndrome (IBS; Mathur et al., 2010) and thyroid dis-
orders (Janssen et al., 2004; Kachuei et al., 2012; Sinha
et al., 2013). Women with PCOS are also at elevated risk of
developing depression (Bhattacharya and Jha, 2010) and
anxiety (Laggari et al., 2009) disorders and have higher
levels of depression and psychological morbidity (Coffey
and Mason, 2003). Indeed, Cipkala-Gaffin et al. (2012)
found that women with PCOS have a higher prevalence
(31%) of mild or moderate depressive symptom levels
compared to a control group (17%). Relatedly, Deeks et al.
(2011) report that women with PCOS have increased
anxiety, depression and negative body image compared to
women without PCOS. Furthermore, women with PCOS
have an impaired quality of life and an increased preva-
lence of psychological morbidity (Ching et al., 2007).
However, Elsenbruch et al. (2006) report that psychiatric
illnesses in women with PCOS may go undetected. Thus,
women with PCOS may experience co-morbidities that
may have a negative impact on their quality of life; how-
ever, the majority of research in this area has been quantita-
tive or has taken place in a clinical setting.
Qualitative research would aide our understanding of
the psychological impact of PCOS, and other conditions,
on quality of life. To date, few studies have explored PCOS

Abstract
Polycystic ovary syndrome is an endocrine disorder affecting 1 in 10 women. Women with polycystic ovary syndrome
can experience co-morbidities, including depressive symptoms. This research explores the experience of living with
polycystic ovary syndrome and co-morbidities. Totally, 10 participants with polycystic ovary syndrome took part in
SkypeTM interviews and analysed using thematic analysis. Four themes emerged from the data: change (to life plans and
changing nature of condition); support (healthcare professionals, education and relationships); co-morbidities (living with
other conditions and depression, self-harm and suicidal ideation) and identity (feminine identity and us and them). The
findings highlight the need for screening of women with polycystic ovary syndrome for depressive disorders.

Report of empirical study
2 Health Psychology Open 
from a qualitative perspective (Crete and Adamshick, 2011;
Holbrey and Coulson, 2013; Williams et al., 2014).
Moreover, those studies excluded women with PCOS who
experienced co-morbidities; Moreira and Azevedo (2006)
argue that incorporating qualitative approaches into PCOS
studies could contribute to our understanding of the impact
of the disease. This study, therefore, aims to explore the
impact of PCOS on quality of life, through qualitative
methods. It is the first such study to explicitly include
women with PCOS who may have other health conditions;
this is of particular importance given the high proportion of
co-morbidities in women with PCOS.
Methods
Online research methods
Women with PCOS are frequently socially isolated
(Kitzinger and Willmott, 2002); therefore, the mode of data
collection needs careful consideration. Seymour (2001)
suggests that online data collection methods enable the
researcher to access inaccessible domains, such as hard to
reach populations or socially isolated groups. Kraut et al.
(2004) also argue that online research could make apparent
psychological phenomena that do not exist in traditional
settings. Sullivan (2012) has proposed that there is poten-
tial for data collection in social research through the use of
technology such as SkypeTM and Google Hangout.
Accordingly, online research may enable access to a
socially isolated population such as women with PCOS.
Deakin and Wakefield (2013) suggest that online syn-
chronous interviews using, for example, Skype are a use-
ful replacement of traditional face-to-face interviews.
They describe several advantages of using Skype to con-
duct interviews including allowing more flexibility for the
researcher and participant, and being more cost and time
efficient. Janghorban et al. (2014) argue that Skype offers
a useful alternative to face-to-face interviews and is suit-
able for conducting individual interviews. Previous
research using Skype has explored online health forums
(Fan et al., 2013) and online psychiatric consultations
(Williams et al., 2014). Williams et al. (2014) found that
there was a high acceptability of online consultations via
Skype in their participants. This suggests that Skype is a
viable way to conduct online research. Accordingly, this
study explored how women with PCOS perceive the
impact of the condition on their quality of life through
online Skype interviews.
Participants
Participants were recruited via the social networking web-
site, Facebook. A recruitment post was posted to different
PCOS support groups available on Facebook after agree-
ment from the group moderator. The inclusion criteria for
this study were as follows: aged 18 and over, lived in the
UK and suffered from symptoms of PCOS. Participants
were not required to have a co-morbidity to take part in the
research. Totally, 10 participants agreed to participate and
were interviewed for 40­90minutes. Of these, nine partici-
pants spontaneously discussed suffering from co-morbidi-
ties, such as depression, IBS and hyperthyroidism, and
therefore just these nine were included in this analysis.
Participants' ages ranged between 20 and 41
years; three
participants chose not to disclose their age.
Materials
Interviews were conducted using Skype (voice call only)
over the Internet. Skype is an online method of making free
video or telephone calls; it also allows for individuals to
send text-based messages to one another for free of cost.
The interviews were recorded using Evaer computer soft-
ware (Evaer Technology, http://www.evaer.com/index.
htm). Interview questions were developed after a review of
the literature and included questions such as, `Could you
describe a typical day living with PCOS?' and `Have you
changed the way you deal with your PCOS and its symp-
toms over time?'
Procedure
After participants had registered their interest in taking part
in the study by email, they were sent an information sheet
and a consent form by return email. They were informed
that they did not need to fill anything in but were advised to
read both documents before deciding whether they wished
to take part in the research, thus ensuring participants had
sufficient time to consider the implications of taking part in
the research (The National Health Service Health Research
Authority (NHS HRA), n.d.). Participants who emailed to
say they would like to take part arranged an interview
appointment with the researcher. At the time of the sched-
uled interview, participants were called through Skype
(Microsoft). The participant was then sent the statements of
consent from the consent form and asked to consent using
the text-based service provided by Skype. They were also
reminded that their information would be stored confiden-
tially and they had a right to withdraw. The researcher then
informed the participant that the Skype call was being
recorded.
Ethics
Research complied with The British Psychological
Society's (BPS, 2009) ethical guidelines and their guide-
lines for Internet-mediated research (BPS, 2013) and ethi-
cal approval was obtained from the Psychology Research
Ethics Committee at the University of Derby (Ethics
Approval Number: 06012-SW).

Analysis
The online interviews were transcribed and then analysed
using an inductive thematic analysis (Braun and Clarke,
2006). Thematic analysis is a method for identifying and
reporting themes within the data, which organises and
describes the data in detail (Braun and Clarke). To analyse
the data according to the six steps recommended by Braun
and Clarke, the transcript was first read and re-read and
then initial codes were generated. Next, the initial codes
were sorted into potential themes. The themes were then
reviewed, defined and named. Finally, the thematic analy-
sis was written up. The final themes were reviewed by two
other health psychology researchers to ensure all were in
agreement, that the themes accurately represented the data
and there was not too much overlap between themes (Braun
and Clarke).
Findings
Participants in this study experienced a variety of symp-
toms including hirsutism, obesity, acne and infertility. The
participants also suffered from other conditions, both phys-
ical and psychological, in addition to their PCOS. Four
major themes emerged from the data: change (to life plans
and changing nature of condition); co-morbidities (living
with other conditions and depression, self-harm and sui-
cidal ideation); support (healthcare professionals, educa-
tion and relationships) and identity (feminine identity and
us and them). All identifying details have been removed
from the quotes and participants have been referred to by
pseudonyms throughout the analysis in order to ensure ano-
nymity (BPS, 2010). Participants who chose not to disclose
their age are denoted by AU.
Change
To life plans
Several participants described how PCOS had caused them to
change their life plans, particularly their plans to start a fam-
ily. In the quote below, Dawn discusses how having a large
family was the `planned thing to do' and what they (her and
her husband) `had planned to do'before they got married:
when me and my husband first got together it was you know,
my husband's one of six, I'm one of five, it was the planned
thing to do and that's what we had planned to do before we got
married erm but it, it, did bother me for a long time, a very long
time actually, erm but I think the older I've gotten and the
older we've gotten the more, I think since I turned 30, it's
become less of an issue, if you like because we've just, we've
got used to it. You know, when I turned 30 we'd been dealing
with it for nearly ten years. So I don't know if it's erm, it might
have impacted to start off with, but it's not, I don't, I used to
look at children and think yeah I'd love one. (Dawn, 36years)
Similarly, Julie (below) states that she had been `dream-
ing' about having a family for almost `30
years'. She dis-
cusses, in the quote below, how the impact of PCOS on her
fertility was `very hard to grasp' as it was something she
had `always wanted' from a young age. The quote illus-
trates how women with PCOS who plan or want a family
may have to change the plans they had for their life:
I really found it very hard to grasp that the one thing that I'd
always wanted right from, well from being a little girl and
playing with, playing with dollies and that sort of thing. I
always knew I wanted children, even before I wanted a
boyfriend. I knew that malarkey and always knew that I wanted
a family and so this thing that I've been sort of looking forward
to and dreaming about for nearly the whole of my 30years was
kind of like the, the rug pulled out from under my feet kind of
thing a little bit and it was erm pretty horrible really. (Julie,
36years)
In contrast to Dawn and Julie, in the quote below Holly
describes how she planned to have kids later in life after she
had established a career. Holly stresses that due to having
PCOS she felt pressured by healthcare professionals to
have children `sooner, rather than later' and change the
`plan' she had for her life:
every doctors tells me that I need to start thinking about having
children sooner rather than later, that's quite a change erm
`cause I'm an army wife so I travel around a lot which makes
it hard to get jobs and kind of puts your career on the back foot
so I was hoping to establish a career, a, a settled base and then
have children but I'm not sure how that's going to work out for
me now. So yeah, I think I probably will have to change my
plan slightly. (Holly, 25years)
The impact of PCOS on the ability to conceive for
women with PCOS has been highlighted previously by
Snyder (2006) who found that women with PCOS felt
uncertain about their ability to become pregnant. Similarly,
all the participants (n
=
10) in Washington's (2008) study
expressed their concerns on their ability to get pregnant
and the impact of their PCOS on conception. This study,
however, is the first to discuss the pressure women with
PCOS feel to have children earlier in life than they may
have originally planned due to pressure from healthcare
professionals.
Research exploring the fertility intentions following
testing for a BRCA1 gene mutation found that predictive
genetic testing for late-onset cancer susceptibility affects
family planning decision-making (Smith et al., 2004).
Fortuny et al. (2009) have also stated that BRCA1/2
genetic results could influence an individual's decisions
regarding reproduction. As such, testing positive for a
BRCA1 or BRCA2 gene mutation may be similar to that
of PCOS when considering the impact a diagnosis could
have on the individual's life plans concerning children.
4 Health Psychology Open 
However, further similarities cannot be assumed due to
the differences in the two conditions, specifically, while
women with BRCA1/2 are faced with a choice that will
impact their life plans, women with PCOS experiencing
fertility issues have this choice removed and as such, have
no control about how their condition will impact their life
plans.
Changing nature of the condition
Several participants describe the changing nature of their
PCOS symptoms and their inability to predict how their
condition will change over their lifetime. Crete
and Adamshick (2011) reported that women with PCOS
were frustrated due to dealing with the uncertainties
of symptoms and diagnosis. Dawn states in the quote
below that her PCOS symptoms have `got worse over the
years' demonstrating how the symptoms of PCOS are
unstable:
It's definitely just got worse over the years. A lot worse erm I
think, I think from the age of 25 its suddenly started kicking
off erm with you know having to start taking care of you know,
the hair issue and it just, as I said, it just seems to be getting
worse. (Dawn, 36years)
Similarly, Holly discusses the changing nature of her
moods as a result of PCOS in the quote below. She
describes how she feels she has `no control ... whatso-
ever' and how she has taken medication to try and control
the symptoms:
I think it's because it's, everything's from the inside out with
PCOS. It's really hard to control anything that happens unless,
unless you want to go on a contraceptive pill, which I don't. I
think that's probably the only way that you control it ... I have
no control over it whatsoever. I can be feeling really good and
really happy and brilliant and then just get a whole load of
spots and think and what is that about? It's really upsetting and
I can feel really low and really depressed about it and my
skin's looking great and I just don't understand it at all. It's
horrible. (Holly, 25years)
Holly was not alone in describing changes she had
made to try and control her PCOS. Each participant
reported trying different medications or symptom man-
agement techniques to try and control or deal with their
symptoms, including hair removal and skin care routines.
This has been reported by several other studies (Crete
and Adamshick, 2011; Kitzinger and Willmott, 2002;
Snyder, 2006). Hsu (2013) suggests that women with
PCOS may experience changes in their PCOS symptoms
with age, particularly in adolescence and later life.
Healthcare professionals should be considerate of these
changes in presenting symptoms in women with PCOS
and offer appropriate support and guidance.
Co-morbidities
Living with other conditions
Six of the participants (Holly, Tanya, Kay, Sharon, Emma
and Dawn) discussed how they lived with other physical
conditions as well as their PCOS. These conditions were
varied and include migraines, IBS, hypermobility syn-
drome, hypothyroidism, adrenal fatigue and fallopian tube
obstruction.
In the quote below, Tanya describes how she has IBS as
well as PCOS. Interestingly, despite suffering from two
chronic health conditions, Tanya states that she and her fam-
ily `don't really suffer from anything'. The quotes below
suggest that for Tanya, she identifies as being well, rather
than `poorly' even with her PCOS and IBS symptoms:
We've never really, we're not really like a poorly family. We
don't really suffer from anything. Mmm I do get a lot of colds,
I always pick everything up. Oh and I do have a, I've actually
just realised, a touch of IBS. (Tanya, AU)
To date, only one study has explored the prevalence of
IBS in women with PCOS. Mathur et al. (2010) found that
not only were women with PCOS more likely to have IBS
than healthy controls, but that women with PCOS and IBS
symptoms were more likely to have a higher body mass
index (BMI) and body fat percentage compared to women
with PCOS but who did not suffer from IBS. In this study,
only Tanya reported experiencing symptoms of IBS; how-
ever, this finding does demonstrate a need for further
research exploring the prevalence, and experience of IBS in
women with PCOS.
Tanya's experience contrasts with Kay who had several
other conditions in addition to PCOS. In the quote below,
Kay discusses how she has asthma, eczema and hypermo-
bility (hypermobility is a condition where people experi-
ence loose or supple joints that can often result in pain). She
explains that she has `quite a bad time with them', suggest-
ing she finds it difficult living with multiple morbidities:
I have erm asthma, erm I have eczema and I also have
hypermobility erm which is basically from the double
jointedness [sic] erm and I have a lot of problems with my
joints, especially my knees erm and I have quite a bad time
with them. (Kay, AU)
The quotes above demonstrate how women with PCOS
may struggle to live with other debilitating conditions in
addition to PCOS. Dawn describes that it was a `hell of a
shock'and `devastating'to learn that she had an additional
health issue to PCOS, suggesting that this was a traumatic
experience for her. This suggests that women with PCOS
and a co-morbid condition may find it difficult to cope,
particularly at the time of diagnosis of the additional
condition:
Williams et al. 5
it was quite a shock because it looks like one of my fallopian
tubes stopped working as well. So I went in to perhaps go and
have erm IVF and I went and had a scan with a, well they inject
a dye into my tubes and erm one of them wouldn't even go up
and it was a hell of a shock just to find out well one of your
tubes is now not working at all and you're not producing erm
the eggs you need and erm all this all down to this, this
polycystic ovary syndrome ... it was very devastating at the
time. (Dawn, 36years)
Depression, self-harm and suicidal ideation
Six participants (Dawn, Kay, Julie, Marie, Debbie and
Tanya) in this study reported suffering from depressive
symptoms including self-harm and suicidal ideation. This
has not previously been reported in any published qualita-
tive research. Quantitative research has shown that women
with PCOS report more depressive symptoms (Himelein
and Thatcher, 2006) and a higher prevalence of depression
(Cipkala-Gaffin et al., 2012; Hollinrake et al., 2007) than
controls even after accounting for BMI and age (Deeks
et al., 2011), but findings from this study show that for
some women this may be particularly severe.
The relationship between PCOS and depression was
discussed by Kay and Marie (below). Kay states that her
depression `is led from' her PCOS suggesting that rather
than her depression being a result of a biological cause,
such as polycystic ovaries, Kay sees it as a result of living
with the symptoms of PCOS. Conversely, Marie states
that it is her PCOS that adds to her depression, suggesting
that she perceives this as a separate phenomenon. This
suggests that participants are not receiving adequate infor-
mation regarding their conditions from their healthcare
professional and may not get the best care for them (Percy
et al., 2009):
`cause I don't, for me polycystic ovaries doesn't create my
depression, my depression is led from the aspects of polycystic
ovaries. (Kay, AU)
I wouldn't have thought the depression would impact the
PCOS really but I suppose it could, I haven't really thought
about that but definitely having the PCOS adds to the
depression because of all the things you hate about yourself
makes it diff, harder. (Marie, 20years)
Marie also admits that she has a history of self-harm.
She discusses how she still thinks about self-harming and
the impact PCOS and her depression have on one another;
she suggests it is `a cycle' between her depression and her
thoughts about her PCOS:
I don't think I deal with it very well because erm I have a
history of self-harming which got quite bad at one point erm I
don't do it anymore but it's always still in my mind so when I
have a really bad day I always still think about doing it. Erm
and when, if I'm depressed about PCOS my thoughts can sort
of go round and round and switch between all the different
things that PCOS is doing and the depression is doing and it's
all just a cycle really as when I do get really depressed it's hard
to get back out of it. (Marie, 20years)
Two participants reported that they had or do self-harm
(Dawn and Marie). Currently, there is no published research
reporting incidences of self-harm in women with PCOS.
Dawn describes how she will self-harm when she gets `hor-
monal surges':
I think I get an over, an overload of testosterone because my
whole attitude changes and it's really unpleasant for my
husband and my family when I go through this, I think, a
hormonal surge ... I will self-harm when I get this. It's like I'm
more reckless, erm it's, it's, I become withdrawn and then I
almost become like dual personality. (Dawn, 36years)
Research by Månsson et al. (2008) has found that sui-
cide attempts were higher in women with PCOS than
age-matched controls; lifetime suicide attempts were
seven times more common for women with PCOS than
controls. Suicidal ideation was briefly discussed by
Tanya (below); she describes how on `really, really blue
days' she would begin to think about `ending it' but that
thinking of her family and the impact it would have on
them helps prevent her from following through with these
thoughts:
I had suffered some days where I was so depressed and so
down I wouldn't leave the house, some days I wouldn't go out
to buy food because I was just so miserable and so fed up and
there are times that you, not that, you just have these really,
really blue days where you just think `Oh God, I'd love to just
end, end it all as in, not, I'm finding it hard to explain it. I
realise by ending it you would obviously end your life but I
feel like if my body just stopped working. If I just shut my
body down and it will all stop and it will stop doing this and it
will stop doing that, but then obviously I just think to myself
it's a selfish way of thinking. (Tanya, AU)
Suicidal ideation is considered a serious psychiatric
issue in patients diagnosed with chronic illnesses (Amer
and Hamdan-Mansour, 2014); however, the way in which
physical illness increases the risk of suicidal behaviour is
not completely understood (O'Connor and Knock, 2014).
Webb et al. (2012) suggest that the link between suicidal
behaviour and physical illness is attributable to depressive
symptomology; however, Scott et al. (2010) report that
the link remains even after controlling for mental disor-
ders. As such, more research is needed to explore these
links within a population of women with PCOS. Moreover,
Carpenter et al. (2000) found that obesity was associated
with an increased risk of depression and suicidal ideation
among women in the United States. Similarly, Ekbäck
6 Health Psychology Open 
et al. (2009) report that women in their study, who suf-
fered from hirsutism, had also contemplated suicide as a
way of escaping their condition. As obesity and hirsutism
are common symptoms of PCOS (Cipkala-Gaffin et al.,
2012), it is important for healthcare professionals to be
aware of this risk in women with PCOS.
Support
Healthcare professionals
Every participant in this study conveyed `frustration' over
the support, or lack of support that they received from
healthcare professionals (Kitzinger and Willmott, 2002).
Several women expressed having to `push'for tests to diag-
nose their PCOS after they are presented to their doctors
with symptoms. This is illustrated by Dawn in the quote
below who presented with symptoms of hirsutism and
infertility:
I think I became a right pain in the butt to the, my doctors
because I kept going on `I think something's not right', you
know, erm and obviously they just, they just kept fobbing
(sic) me off. You know, `you'll grow out of it', erm and I
think it was, it was because I started getting erm like quite a
heavy moustache on my top lip ... I couldn't fall pregnant
after six months that they actually put me through for a
scan. Erm so, yeah so then I reckon yeah it's when they
found out that I had the little string of pearls going on.
(Dawn, 36years)
Holly also describes how her doctors made her feel like
her symptoms were not real. She discusses how she saw
several general practitioners (GPs) before she was able to
take the tests to diagnose PCOS:
I saw a doctor and he said I'll treat you as if you have got
PCOS but I'm not going to do any tests and, and this wasn't
good enough. So I went to another GP and she said `no
absolutely, let's do your tests' erm and it just strikes me that
doctor's, GPs especially just don't really know anything about
PCOS. (Holly, 25years)
Several participants described a similar experience of
visiting several GPs before getting what they perceived was
appropriate care. This appears to be a common problem for
women with PCOS (Crete and Adamshick, 2011; Snyder,
2006; Washington, 2005). These findings suggest that
healthcare professionals need to be more supportive of
women with PCOS particularly at the time of diagnosis,
and that there is a need for them to recognise the impact of
this condition, and co-morbid conditions, on an individu-
al's quality of life. Future research exploring these phe-
nomena from a healthcare provider's perspective may help
shed new light on this problem and how this may be
improved.
Education
Several participants in this research resorted to researching
and educating themselves about their condition due to a
lack of information and support from their healthcare pro-
fessionals. Dawn describes below how she felt when she
was diagnosed, and that she was left to research her condi-
tion and educate herself about PCOS:
It's just like we've got this, this label of polycystic ovaries and but
there's not a lot of explanation and that was about, oh goodness
me, that was about 15years ago and it was up to me to sort of like
try and research as much as I could on it. (Dawn, 36years)
Holly also proactively researched her condition using
books and the Internet (blogs) that allowed her to create her
`own action plan' in order to be better able to manager her
condition. She explains that although there is `a wealth of
information out there' this is not from healthcare profes-
sionals but from women with PCOS who are `doing it
themselves':
So when I got the diagnosis it made me, you know, I could go
out and read the books and read the blogs and come up with
my own action plan; which I did ... So it really does, there's
such a wealth of information out there, but unfortunately it's
not from the medical erm industry, it's from people doing it
themselves, people who want to cure it naturally. (Holly,
25years)
Later in the interview, Holly goes on to discuss that
doing her own research and trying new ways to manage her
symptoms can become `exhausting'. She also describes
how, if new methods do not work it can lead her to going
`back down to that low place', suggesting that the trial and
error process of research can be taxing:
I do lots of research and I think oh I'll try this. I'll try something
new and you kind of rally yourself to do new things and then
you realise it's not going to work, it's not working then you go
back down to that low place and then you've got to rally
yourself up again to try something else and it's just, it's quite
exhausting just always, I don't know. (Holly, 25years)
These findings accord with Snyder's (2006) who found
that women with PCOS actively searched for answers with-
out the help of a healthcare professional. Similarly, Crete and
Adamshick (2011) found that participants in their study dis-
cussed formally searching for answers through the use of
online resources and books, supporting the findings of this
study that suggest that women with PCOS self-educate.
Relationships
Several participants found support and information from
other women with PCOS by using online support groups.
Williams et al. 7
Holly found support from women with PCOS online,
claiming that they have `more knowledge' than her family
and are `more understanding'. The quote below demon-
strates how Holly's family was unable to `understand' her
condition in a way that other women with PCOS could,
even though they were supportive. Thus, using online sup-
port groups may help reduce feelings of loneliness or isola-
tion in women with PCOS:
I think erm these women have er more knowledge than my
family about it and they're more understanding. My family are
supportive but they don't understand it at all. Even my sister
whose got PCOS, she has, she hasn't really got any symptoms
other than a bit of excess hair. She's never even researched it
because she doesn't feel she needs to but these women online,
they've done so much research and, and they're so supportive.
(Holly, 25years)
This concurs with Holbrey and Coulson (2013) who
found that participation in an online support group for
women with PCOS can help women feel empowered, as it
allows them to connect with other women with PCOS and
enables them to access information and advice.
Identity
Feminine identity
Six participants (Tanya, Dawn, Emma,Anna, Julie and Kay)
discussed their PCOS in relation to their identity as a
woman. Washington (2008) also found that for women with
PCOS, the condition could have a negative impact on their
self-concept including their self-image and their femininity.
In the quote below, Tanya describes how instead of feel-
ing `sexy' or `attractive', because of her PCOS she feels
like a `man'. She states that she feels `like a freak' because
of her PCOS and its symptoms, suggesting she thinks she is
abnormal because of her condition. Kitzinger and Willmott
(2002) also found that their participants described them-
selves as `freaks' because of the symptoms of their PCOS:
I think, as a woman, you, you want to feel sexy. You want to
feel attractive to the opposite sex. I think when you have these
problems, you don't. You feel like a freak. You feel like a man.
(Tanya, AUyears)
A number of women talked about having masculine
attributes due to symptoms of PCOS, threatening their
identity as a woman; women with PCOS can see them-
selves as unfeminine, often using male language and termi-
nology to refer to their PCOS and its symptoms (Williams
et al., 2014):
I've got a very good sense of humour about it because
sometimes I swear I'm just like one penis away from turning
into a guy. (Dawn, 36years)
I'm waiting for the day when one of them is drunk and
particularly aggressive and mentions it erm and makes some
comment along the lines of bearded lady or God knows what
they'd do. (Emma, 25years)
Similarly, Washington (2008) describes how partici-
pants felt that PCOS negatively impacted on all areas
they associated with being a woman because of symp-
toms such as hirsutism, alopecia and infertility problems.
Snyder (2006) found that women with PCOS felt that
their symptoms impacted on their perception of them-
selves as female and reported that women with PCOS
wanted to be normal and look more feminine. Kitzinger
and Willmott (2002) also found that women with PCOS
felt challenged in their perception of themselves as
women because of their symptoms.
Us and them
Several participants discussed how they felt it was `unfair'
that they had PCOS compared to other women without
PCOS. Tanya states that it is `really unfair' that she suffers
from PCOS and `not' other `people', questioning `why' she
has the condition:
I do wonder a lot, why me? Why, why did I have to it and not,
and not people? I don't know anybody else whose got it er and
part of me does feel like my bodies let me down and, and it's
really unfair. (Tanya, AU)
Snyder (2006) found that women with PCOS identified
themselves as different to women without the condition.
The participants in this study made social comparisons that
could have a negative impact on the quality of life and
adjustment to the condition (Dibb and Yardley, 2006). This
is also demonstrated in the quote below by Debbie:
I suppose you have to think more about things rather than
when other people wouldn't really give, like other women and
stuff probably wouldn't give thoughts to. (Debbie, AUyears)
Discussion
This research explored the impact of PCOS and co-morbid
conditions on women who have PCOS and found four
super ordinate themes: change (to life plans and changing
nature of condition); co-morbidities (living with other con-
ditions and depression, self-harm and suicide); support
(healthcare professionals, education and relationships) and
identity (feminine identity and us and them). The themes of
support and identity have been discussed previously in the
literature (Kitzinger and Willmott, 2002). However, this
research is the first to explicitly explore women's experi-
ences of living with PCOS and co-morbid conditions. Thus,
this research is the first to report how women with PCOS
8 Health Psychology Open 
and co-morbid conditions perceive its impact on their life
plans and how they manage their conditions.
While quantitative research has described the preva-
lence of depression in women with PCOS (Bhattacharya
and Jha, 2010), this study is the first to report how women
with PCOS experience and live with this condition and
other co-morbidities such as IBS. Over half of the partici-
pants in this study discussed depression, self-harm and/or
suicide; yet, there is little discussion of self-harm and sui-
cide in the literature. Of the two studies that do exist, both
explore this using quantitative methodology and a clinical
sample (Hart and Doherty, 2014; Månsson et al., 2008);
therefore, they do not attempt to understand how women
with PCOS experience this. This suggests that the experi-
ence of living with PCOS and depression is under
researched. Healthcare professionals should be aware that
women with PCOS are likely to report depressive symp-
toms, self-harm and suicide and therefore, offer them nec-
essary and appropriate support. Further research should
explore the prevalence of self-harm in women with PCOS
and aim to develop interventions to decrease depressive
symptoms in this population.
This study also highlights how women with PCOS may
feel under pressure to have children from healthcare pro-
fessionals and the impact this can have on their life plans.
The experience of being pressured to conceive by health-
care professionals appears to be a unique phenomenon for
women with PCOS; women who test positively for the
BRCA1 and BRCA2 gene mutation may also experience
a similar impact on their plans to have children (Smith
et al., 2004). However, for women with the BRCA1 and
BRCA2 gene, this impact may be a choice of whether to
have children or not, for women with PCOS this choice
can be removed. Certainly, research suggests that infertile
women report a poorer quality of life compared to con-
trols (Monga et al., 2004) and they experience similar
psychological symptoms to those associated with cancer,
hypertension and cardiac rehabilitation (Domar et al.,
1993). Infertility can have a large negative impact on the
women who experience it, without the perceived added
pressure to conceive from a healthcare professional that
some women with PCOS experience. Thus, research is
needed that explores the psychological impact that pres-
sure from a healthcare professional to conceive may have
on women with PCOS.
The use of Skype interviews in this study meant partici-
pants, who described themselves as socially isolated, were
easily able to take part, and the costs, including time and
financial costs, were minimal to both the researcher and the
participant. The online interviews may have allowed par-
ticipants to feel comfortable, as evidenced by participant's
behaviours, such as answering doors or watching their chil-
dren, demonstrating minimal interference in their day-to-
day lives. Nevertheless, while providing an important
account of women's experiences living with PCOS and co-
morbid conditions, there were a number of limitations with
this study. Indeed, it is possible that the presence of chil-
dren may have had a negative impact on the participant's
openness and willingness to discuss their experiences with
PCOS and any co-morbid conditions.
Using Skype was a viable method for data collection for
this study, but there were issues with the technology itself
(Saumure and Given, 2010) in the form of noise interfer-
ence on calls which could have had a negative impact on
the interviews and resulted in missing information.
Participants in this study were self-selecting and all were
recruited through PCOS support groups on the social net-
working website Facebook. Therefore, it could be argued
that the women in this study were already seeking support
for their PCOS. It is unclear what, if any, support partici-
pants received for their co-morbidities from either PCOS
groups, or indeed other support groups on Facebook.
Participants were not required to have co-morbidities,
nor were they asked to provide information on clinical
diagnoses of any conditions to take part. However, this
resulted in the participants spontaneously discussing their
co-morbidities, highlighting the importance of these to the
participants. While previous studies have explored the
prevalence of specific co-morbidities (including diabetes,
hypertension, sleep apnoea, anxiety, depression) in a popu-
lation of women with PCOS (Bethea and Nestler, 2008;
Sirmans et al., 2014), there is a need for further research
which explores the prevalence and impact of clinically
diagnosed co-morbidities in women with PCOS in the
United Kingdom, which is inclusive of the conditions men-
tioned by participants in this study. It also highlights the
need for future studies with women with PCOS to be inclu-
sive of co-morbid conditions.
In conclusion, this research has identified several new
areas of importance for healthcare professionals and
researchers including occurrences of self-harm and suicidal
ideation in women with PCOS. Additionally, this study
highlights participants' experiences of living with co-, or
often multiple morbidities as well as their PCOS and its
associated symptoms. It reports the apparent unique occur-
rence of changing life plans due to the condition and conse-
quently, with regard to family planning, the pressure placed
on individuals by healthcare professionals to conceive.
Finally, it also highlights the need for appropriate support
to be available for women with PCOS to help deal with the
psychological and physical symptoms arising from their
condition(s).
