The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention (CDC) estimates that 310,000
children between 1 and 6 years of age in the
United States have blood lead (PbB) levels > 10
micrograms per deciliter (CDC 2005). The
health effects associated with PbB levels at or
above this level of concern have been well doc-
umented, including learning and behavioral
problems (National Research Council 1993).
Evidence suggests that children with PbB < 10
µg/dL also experience notable adverse effects
and that no safe level of lead exposure exists
(Canfield et al. 2003; CDC 1991; Lanphear
et al. 2000, 2005b; Schwartz 1994). In this
study we identified factors associated with
childhood residential dust lead (PbD) exposure.
Lead exposure can occur through a variety
of sources, including air, bare soil, home rem-
edies, drinking water, toy jewelry, and others
(Levin et al. 2008). However, the major path-
way of exposure for children is from deterio-
rated lead-based paint and lead-contaminated
dust in the home that is ingested during nor-
mal hand-to-mouth behavior (CDC 2007;
Lanphear et al. 1998). The importance of
PbD from lead paint was recognized very
early (Gibson 1904), and work was done sub-
sequently in an attempt to quantify its expo-
sure contribution (Sayre et al. 1974).
Although lead-based paint was banned
from residential use in 1978, approximately
38 million older housing units in the United
States still contained lead-based paint, and an
estimated 24 million housing units contain sig-
nificant lead hazards as of 2000 (Jacobs et al.
2002). Although intact paint does not gener-
ally result in significant immediate exposure, all
paint eventually deteriorates; lead-based paint
that is chipping, peeling, or flaking or other-
wise separating from its substrate presents a
hazard. In addition, lead-contaminated settled
dust, which is often found in houses with dete-
riorated lead-based paint, is a significant lead
hazard (Lanphear et al. 1998). PbD can also be
generated from the friction and impact of lead-
painted surfaces (Dixon et al. 2007) and during
housing renovation and repair projects where
lead-based paint is present and proper precau-
tions are not in place (Lanphear et al. 2005a;
Reissman et al. 2002). The use of leaded gaso-
line, which peaked in the early 1970s, has also
contaminated soil around the home (Mielke
1999). Many studies, employing a variety of
research designs, have demonstrated that soil-
lead concentrations are a significant contribu-
tor to PbD and children's PbB (Bornschein
et al. 1987; Clark et al. 2004; Dixon et al.
2007; Lanphear et al. 1998). Numerous
cross-sectional (Lanphear et al. 1998) and
longitudinal studies [U.S. Department of
Housing and Urban Development (HUD)
2004] have firmly established the correlation
of settled PbD and children's PbB. In an effort
to protect young children from adverse effects
of lead, current federal health-based hazard
standards indicate that floor and window PbD
should not exceed 40 µg/ft2 and 250 µg/ft2,
respectively [U.S. Environmental Protection
Agency (EPA) 2001].
Through an interagency agreement with
the CDC, the U.S. HUD Office of Healthy
Homes and Lead Hazard Control sponsored
the collection of PbD wipe samples and
housing-related data through the National
Health and Nutrition Examination Survey
(NHANES) from 1999 through 2004, mark-
ing the first time that NHANES has collected
both health and housing environmental data.
Using these national survey data, we investi-
gated PbD in homes to explore the feasibility
of lowering PbD standards. Here we present
the demographic and housing characteristics
associated with floor and windowsill PbD. We
used linear regression modeling to predict nat-
ural log-transformed floor and windowsill PbD
and logistic regression modeling to predict the
log odds of PbD at various levels. A compan-
ion article in this issue (Dixon et el. 2009)
presents the analysis of NHANES data with
respect to childhood PbB levels. Together these
data identify the important risk factors and the
relationship between PbD and children's PbB
in the United States in recent years.

Background: Lead-contaminated house dust is a major source of lead exposure for children in the
United States. In 1999­2004, the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES)
collected dust lead (PbD) loading samples from the homes of children 12­60 months of age.
Objectives: In this study we aimed to compare national PbD levels with existing health-based stan-
dards and to identify housing and demographic factors associated with floor and windowsill PbD.
Methods: We used NHANES PbD data (n = 2,065 from floors and n = 1,618 from windowsills)
and covariates to construct linear and logistic regression models.
Results: The population-weighted geometric mean floor and windowsill PbD were 0.5 µg/ft2
[geometric standard error (GSE) = 1.0] and 7.6 µg/ft2 (GSE = 1.0), respectively. Only 0.16% of
the floors and 4.0% of the sills had PbD at or above current federal standards of 40 and 250 µg/ft2,
respectively. Income, race/ethnicity, floor surface/condition, windowsill PbD, year of construction,
recent renovation, smoking, and survey year were significant predictors of floor PbD [the propor-
tion of variability in the dependent variable accounted for by the model (R2) = 35%]. A similar set
of predictors plus the presence of large areas of exterior deteriorated paint in pre-1950 homes and
the presence of interior deteriorated paint explained 20% of the variability in sill PbD. A compan-
ion article [Dixon et al. Environ Health Perspect 117:468­474 (2009)] describes the relationship
between children's blood lead and PbD.
Conclusion: Most houses with children have PbD levels that comply with federal standards but
may put children at risk. Factors associated with PbD in our population-based models are primarily
the same as factors identified in smaller at-risk cohorts. PbD on floors and windowsills should be
kept as low as possible to protect children.

2003­2004) data for children 12 to 60 months
of age with measured PbB. Included in this
population were homes of 2,155 children, of
which 2,065 had floor PbD data and 1,618
had windowsill PbD data. NHANES is a
nationally representative cross-sectional house-
hold survey that uses a complex, stratified,
multistage probability sampling design to track
the health of the noninstitutionalized civilian
U.S. population. Details of the NHANES
protocol, survey and analytical procedures,
and handling of samples are available else-
where [National Center for Health Statistics
(NCHS) 2006a, 2006b, 2006c].
Demographic and housing characteristics.
NHANES interviewers collected demographic
and housing information through a structured
household interview. Characteristics included
child's race/ethnicity, household and family
income, type of home (e.g., mobile home or
trailer, one-family house detached, one-family
house attached to one or more houses, apart-
ment, or "other"), number of apartment units
in building, year of construction, number of
years the family had lived in the home, owner-
ship status, and smoking in the home. Parents
of participants reported the race/ethnicity
of their child based on lists that included an
open response. We used a composite race/eth-
nicity variable for this analysis: non-Hispanic
white, non-Hispanic black, Hispanic (com-
posed mostly of Mexican American because
of oversampling), or other race or ethnicity.
The poverty-to-income ratio (PIR) is the ratio
of income to the family's appropriate pov-
erty threshold (Office of Management and
Budget 1978). PIR values < 1.00 are below
the poverty threshold, whereas PIR values
of  1.00 indicate income above the poverty
level. Variables on smoking behavior included
the presence of smoking in the home, num-
ber of smokers, and the number of cigarettes
smoked in the home per day. An adult mem-
ber of the household reported the presence
of peeling, chipping, or flaking paint (i.e.,
deteriorated) inside and outside the home.
The household member categorized the paint
condition inside the house as follows: no dete-
riorated paint, deteriorated paint but no large
areas, large areas of deteriorated paint in one
room, or large areas of deteriorated paint in
more than one room. Similarly, the house-
hold member classified the exterior paint con-
dition as no deteriorated paint, deteriorated
paint but no large areas, or large areas of dete-
riorated paint. Large areas inside the home
were defined as areas larger than one sheet of
a newspaper and large areas on the outside of
the home as areas larger than a door.
The household member also reported
whether the home had been repainted, whether
they had scraped old paint or whether there
had been renovations of windows, cabinets,
and/or walls in the preceding 12 months.
PbD measurements. Interviewers collected
separate single-surface floor and windowsill
PbD samples from the room where the fam-
ily member reported that children spent most
of their time while awake, typically the living
room or play room. Floor PbD wipe samples
were collected from a measured 1 ft2 area
in 2,065 homes using a standard procedure
for moist wipes (ASTM E-1728-03; ASTM
International 2003). Floor PbD was measured
using graphite furnace atomic absorption
spectroscopy and reported in micrograms per
square foot. Windowsill PbD in 1,618 homes
was also reported as micrograms per square
foot using information on the length and
width dimensions of the windowsill wiped
area. The laboratory detection limits (DLs)
for the moist wipe samples were 0.16 µg for
floors and 2 µg for windowsills. Blank samples
were collected in 10% of the sampled homes.
Robust laboratory quality control procedures
were followed (NCHS 2006d, 2006e, 2006f).
Floor and sill PbD values that were below
the DLs were assigned the value of DL/
­
2 in
the NHANES dust analysis data set. Forty-four
percent of the sill loadings and 12.5% of the
floor loadings were below the DLs. Although
sill loadings are generally higher than floor
PbD, the surface area of windowsills is typically
less than the 1 ft2 sampled on floors, resulting
in more sill loadings below the DL. The effects
of the high percentage of sill loadings below
the DL in the linear model are limited because
the surface areas of sills sampled varied and
consequently the loadings varied.
We categorized the floor's surface and
condition as uncarpeted smooth and clean-
able, uncarpeted not smooth or not clean-
able, low-pile carpet, or high-pile carpet.
Windowsill conditions were characterized
as either smooth and cleanable or not. The
modeling presented here also examined room
cleanliness, presence of clutter, and room
location as reported by the individual collect-
ing the wipe sample.
Statistical methods. We analyzed data
using SAS (SAS System for Windows, ver-
sion 9.1.3; SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC)
and SUDAAN software (version 9.0.0; RTI
International, Research Triangle Park, NC).
We used linear regression models to pre-
dict natural log-transformed PbD and logistic
regression models to predict the probability
that a home's PbD exceeds various thresholds
(10 µg lead/ft2 for floors and 100 and 250 µg/
ft2 for windowsills). Models for 10 µg/ft2 for
floors and 100 µg/ft2 for windowsills were
selected because analyses in the companion
article indicate that 95% of children 1­5 years
of age would have PbB  10 µg/dL at these
dust lead levels. Because only three homes in
the data set had floor PbD exceeding the fed-
eral hazard standard of 40 µg/ft2, we could
not use logistic regression modeling to predict
the probability that floor PbD exceeded the
standard. The models adjusted the parameter
estimates for the clustering and unequal sur-
vey weights within NHANES. The modeling
employed Taylor series expansion theory with-
out degrees of freedom adjustments. Backward
elimination of insignificant independent vari-
ables (p > 0.10) was followed by additional
steps to allow addition and/or removal of vari-
ables. For certain variables, there was a high
percentage of missing values (e.g., 28% of the
study sample did not have year of construction
documented). We fit an intercept term for the
study participants who had a missing value
so that we could include these homes in the
analysis. For categorical variables, we reported
the p-value for the test for a significant differ-
ence in the dependent variable between the
category of interest and the comparison cat-
egory, where the comparison category is the
category with parameter estimate of zero. The
overall p-value is the type 3 F-test that cap-
tures the overall statistical significance of each
variable included in the model. For categorical
variables with missing values, the missing level
was not included in this hypothesis test.

Environmental Health Perspectives · volume 117 | number 3 | March 2009 463
Because the surface area and concentra-
tion of lead paint is higher in pre-1978 and
particularly pre-1950 housing (Jacobs et al.
2002), our models allowed the effects of paint
deterioration, renovation, repainting, and
paint scraping in the preceding 12 months
to be modified by the year of construction.
This allowed paint deterioration, renovation,
repainting, and paint scraping to have effects
on PbD only in homes constructed before
1978 or before 1950.
Model diagnosis is complex for the analy-
sis of data from a clustered multiframe survey
with unequal weights, such as NHANES.
Thus for the linear models, residual analysis
to assess the validity of the assumption of nor-
mality of the error was based on models with
the same predictors but ignoring the cluster-
ing and survey weights.
For the logistic model, we used analysis
of deviance (McCullagh and Nelder 1989)
to assess the goodness of fit of the model.
Although this measure accounts for the survey
weights, it does not account for the effects of
clustering.
Results
Characteristics of the study population. Tables
1 and 2 provide descriptive statistics for the
continuous and categoric variables that were
significant in predicting floor and window-
sill PbD in the linear and logistic regression
models. The geometric means (GMs) for floor
and windowsill PbD were 0.52 µg/ft2 and
7.64 µg/ft2, respectively. Only 0.16% of the
weighted floor dust samples and 4.00% of the
windowsill dust samples were at or above the
current federal hazard standards. Most floor
and sill samples (84.3%) were collected in
family rooms, living rooms, or dens. Nearly
10% of the samples were collected in bed-
rooms, 1.7% from kitchens, 1.4% from din-
ing rooms, and 3.10% from another room.
Floor dust samples were primarily from
carpeted areas (80.12%). Only 1% of floor
dust samples and 10% of windowsill sam-
ples were from nonsmooth or noncleanable
hard surfaces. However, uncarpeted floor sur-
faces that were not smooth or not cleanable
had higher GM PbD than did smooth and
cleanable surfaces (1.7 µg/ft2 vs. 1.0 µg/ft2).
Floor PbD from smooth and cleanable sur-
faces were more than double PbD on low-pile
and high-pile carpeted surfaces (1.0 µg/ft2
vs. 0.46 µg/ft2 and 0.35 µg/ft2, respectively).
Approximately 21% of homes had smoking
occurring inside the home, 22% of homes
had reported areas of deteriorated paint inside
the home, 52% of homes were built before
1978, and 4% of homes were constructed
before 1950 and had recent renovations. Only
1.7% of homes reported exterior deteriorated
paint, possibly because of the large surface
area required for this category.

Floor PbD linear model. Table 3 provides
the parameter estimates and associated SEs
for the linear model that predicts natural log-
transformed floor PbD.
Floor PbD was not significantly different
between housing built from 1978 to 1989
and that from 1990 to present, although the
difference between pre- and post-1978 was
significant (p < 0.001). The difference in PbD
by race/ethnicity was also significant, with
non-Hispanic blacks having significantly
higher levels than non-Hispanic whites (p
< 0.001). PbD in Hispanic homes was not
significantly different than non-Hispanic
white homes (p = 0.864). A higher PIR was
significantly associated with lower PbD (p
= 0.021). Higher windowsill PbD was sig-
nificantly associated with higher floor PbD
(p < 0.001). Floor PbD in the 1999­2000
NHANES was significantly higher than floor
PbD in the 2001­2002 or 2003­2004 waves
(both p < 0.001). The presence of a smoker
in the home was associated with significantly
higher floor PbD (p < 0.006), as was window,
cabinet, or wall renovation in pre-1950 homes
(p = 0.056).
Although floor PbD on uncarpeted nons-
mooth or noncleanable floors was higher than
on smooth and cleanable floors, this difference
was not statistically significant (p = 0.170), per-
haps because only 25 homes had uncarpeted
floors that were not smooth and cleanable.
This multivariate statistical model explains
35% of the variability in floor PbD of a
home. If a variable was significant in either
the linear or logistic model but not the other
model, the cells for that variable in the model
that did not contain the variable in Table 3
contain a dash (--).
Floor PbD logistic model. Only 1.92% of
homes had floor PbD  10 µg/ft2 (Table 2).
The parameter estimates for the log-odds that
floor PbD is  10 µg/ft2 are shown in Table 3.
Our results indicate that PbD from high-pile
or low-pile carpet is much less likely to exceed
10 µg/ft2 than PbD from smooth and clean-
able floors (p < 0.001 and 0.024, respectively).
Floor PbD in homes of non-Hispanic blacks
was higher than in homes of non-Hispanic
whites (p = 0.088). Year of construction, type
of home or apartment, and sill PbD were also
significant predictors of floor PbD  10 µg/
ft2. Several variables, including PIR, smok-
ing in the home, renovation, and survey year,
were significant in the linear regression model
but were not significant in the logistic model.
Windowsill PbD linear model. Table 4
provides the parameter estimates and associ-
ated SEs for the linear model that predicts
natural log-transformed windowsill PbD.
Homes built after 1950 had lower win-

deteriorated interior paint was associated with
higher sill PbD (p = 0.028). Pre-1950 homes
that had large areas of deteriorated paint on
the outside of the home also had higher sill
PbD than other homes (p = 0.076). Homes of
non-Hispanic blacks had significantly higher
sill PbD than homes of non-Hispanic whites
(p < 0.001). Sill PbD in homes of Hispanics
were not significantly different from that in
homes of non-Hispanic whites (p = 0.298).
Smoking inside the home was also positively
associated with sill PbD (p = 0.001). Samples
taken from surfaces that were not smooth or
not cleanable had significantly higher PbD
compared with samples taken from smooth
and cleanable surfaces (p = 0.009), as was the
case for floors. Similar to the linear floor PbD
model, the year of the survey was statistically
significant. The sill PbD in 1999­2000 was
higher than in the 2001­2002 or 2003­2004
waves (p = 0.006).
The multivariate statistical model explains
20% of the variability in natural-log trans-
formed windowsill PbD.
Windowsill PbD logistic regression mod-
els. Only 8.90% of the homes had window-
sill PbD  100 µg/ft2, and 4.00% of homes
yielded windowsill PbD  250 µg/ft2 (Table
2). The parameter estimates for the log-odds
that a windowsill PbD is  100 µg/ft2 and
 250 µg/ft2 are shown in Table 5.
In both logistic models, smoking in the
home and year of construction were sta-
tistically significant predictors. If someone
smoked inside the home, the odds that the sill
PbD was  100 or  250 µg/ft2 were nearly
90% higher than if no one smoked inside the
home.
Interestingly, in the logistic model for
PbD  100 µg/ft2, the odds that sill PbD was
 100 µg/ft2 for homes with large areas of
exterior deteriorated paint was about three
times higher than for homes with no exterior
deteriorated paint. In the logistic model for

PbD  250 µg/ft2, if the interior paint dete-
rioration was large in two or more rooms,
the odds that sill PbD was  250 µg/ft2 were
about three times higher than if there was no
interior paint deterioration.
Most variables that achieved statistical
significance did so in more than one of the
three sill PbD models, making these findings
robust. For example, smoking and year of
building construction were significant in all
three models. Paint scraping in the preceding
12 months and the years lived in the home
were only significant in the logistic model for
PbD  100 µg/ft2. Window surface condition
was only significant in the linear model.
Discussion
Consistent with other national data (Jacobs
et al. 2002), we confirm that the year of con-
struction is a strong predictor of PbD and
that post-1978 housing has significantly lower
PbD than older housing. Housing units built
after 1950 have significantly lower floor PbD
than older housing. Furthermore, floor PbD
in houses built between 1940 and 1949 are
not significantly different than in the pre-
1940 houses. This is consistent with the
concentration of lead in paint. Before 1940,
this concentration typically ranged from 10
to 50% (Rabin 1989; U.S. HUD 1995).
However, in 1955, a voluntary paint industry
standard limited the concentration to 1%,
although the degree of compliance with this
standard is unknown (American National
Standards Institute 1955). In 1978, the
Consumer Product Safety Commission and
Congress banned the use of lead paint for res-
idential use, limiting lead in new house paint
to 0.06% by weight (Consumer Products
Safety Commission 1977).
Pre-1950 homes with window, cabinet,
or wall renovation within the preceding 12
months had higher floor PbD than other
homes. Renovation activities completed with-
out using lead-safe work practices can gener-
ate significant amounts of PbD (Jacobs et al.
2003). The U.S. EPA recently promulgated
a final regulation in an attempt to control
exposures from renovation (U.S. EPA 2008).
Replacing windows in a lead-safe manner can
help control PbD and may have large eco-
nomic benefits (Nevin et al. 2008). Compared
with other housing components, windows are
known to have the highest levels of lead-based
paint and lead-contaminated dust (Jacobs
et al. 2002).
We found that dust wipe samples taken
from homes with chipping, peeling, or flaking
(i.e., deteriorated) paint had higher windowsill
PbD than homes without deteriorated paint,
which is consistent with other research (U.S.
HUD 2004; Wilson et al. 2006). Although
we expected to see similar findings for floors,
we did not. This could be attributable to other
factors included in the model. For example,
PIR and recent renovation were significant
in the floor model, but not in the windowsill
model, which could have masked the effect
of deteriorated paint. In addition, it is more
likely that floors are more regularly cleaned
than windowsills.
The homes of non-Hispanic blacks had
significantly higher PbD than the homes of
non-Hispanic whites, even after controlling for
other factors. Many prior studies have shown
that African-American children are at higher
risk compared with white children (U.S. CDC
2005). For example, similar to our findings,
other studies (Lanphear et al. 1996, 2002)
found that African-American children were
exposed to higher PbD loadings and worse
housing conditions than white children.
Previously published studies suggest that
rental units were more likely to have lead-based
paint hazards than owner-occupied housing
(Jacobs et al. 2002; Lanphear et al. 2005a).
Although we found that homeownership sta-
tus was a significant predictor of floor PbD in
bivariate analysis, after controlling for other fac-
tors such as PIR, renovation, and the presence
of deteriorating paint, it was not significant in
the final models. Because low-income fami-
lies are more likely to rent, the fact that home
ownership was not significant in the model
(but poverty was) is not surprising. Moreover,
the type of home had a significant association
with PbD in bivariate analysis, but not in the
final models, again probably because of the
confounding influence of poverty.
A prior study found a relationship between
exposure to environmental tobacco smoke
exposure and the PbB levels of young chil-
dren who were included in the NHANES III
(1988­1994) (Mannino et al. 2003). Because
lead is a component of tobacco smoke, such a
relationship between PbB levels and tobacco
smoke exposure is not surprising. That smok-
ing in the home was a significant predictor of
floor and windowsill PbD, even when control-
ling other factors, suggests that lead in second-
hand smoke is a significant contributor to lead
on interior surfaces, at least at the relatively
low surface loadings documented in this study.
We found that the surface condition from
which the PbD samples were taken signifi-
cantly influences the reported PbD. Other
studies have found that uncarpeted smooth
and cleanable surfaces have significantly
lower PbD after cleaning compared with
rough uncarpeted surfaces (Dixon et al. 1999;
Ettinger et al. 2002). Although our results
indicated that floor PbD on uncarpeted non-
smooth or noncleanable surfaces was not sig-
nificantly higher than floor PbD on smooth
and cleanable surfaces, the trend was in the
expected direction. It is possible that our find-
ings were not statistically significant because
of the small number of dust samples taken
from nonsmooth or noncleanable floor sur-
faces in this data set.
The presence of carpeting also influ-
enced reported PbD. We found that PbD
on carpeted floors was significantly lower
than lead loadings on hard-surfaced floors.
This observed difference in lead loading by
flooring type is likely attributable to the fact
that wipe sampling was the methodology
used in this study. Wipe sampling captures
only dust adhering to the tops of the carpet
fibers, whereas most of the dust in the carpet
matrix is located deeper in the pile. A study
that reported much higher PbD in vacuum
samples from carpet compared with adja-
cent wipe samples (Bai et al. 2003) supports
this idea. The significance of this observation
with respect to children's lead exposure is not
well understood. Our findings do not clarify
whether or not carpet contributes to higher or
lower exposures.
The NHANES survey year was signifi-
cantly associated with PbD. Although PbD
should decline with time as the ratio of post-
1978 to pre-1978 homes increases, the mag-
nitude of the decline (14%) for the floor PbD
between the first and second waves was much
larger than expected. Similarly, the magnitude
of the decline (43%) between the first and
second waves for windowsill PbD is unlikely
to be explained only by temporal changes
in national PbD. Although many housing
characteristics were included in the model,
other significant factors that we were unable
to control for may exist (e.g., different waves
of NHANES sampling may occur in different
geographic regions). Thus, the year of survey
variable may reflect geographic differences
in the three study wave locations that could
account for the observed trend in floor PbD.
We used data from a large national sur-
vey that combined housing and environmen-
tal data, which is a strength of our study.
However, the housing data included in this
study may not be representative of the national
housing stock. The sampling and weighting
methodology used in NHANES is population
based, not geography based; thus, the survey
includes a nationally representative sample
of the U.S. population but not a representa-
tive sample of U.S. housing. Integrated health
and housing surveys that are representative of
both the population and the housing stock are
needed in the United States; such surveys were
completed recently in eight European cities
(Bonnefoy et al. 2003). Finally, a limitation of
the NHANES PbD data is that they are based
on a single floor and a single windowsill PbD
measurement in a given home. The HUD
Guidelines for the Evaluation and Control of
Lead-Based Paint Hazard in Housing recom-
mend that six to eight floor and sill samples be
taken to help reduce spatial variability, which
could not be assessed here (U.S. HUD 1995).

Despite these potential limitations, the study
results presented are largely consistent with
earlier findings.
Levels of PbD on floors and windowsills
should be kept as low as possible to protect
children from lead exposure. The current stan-
dards for floor and windowsill PbD were set in
1999­2001 to protect 95% of children from
developing a PbB level > 15 µg/dL [the envi-
ronmental intervention level established by the
CDC (2005)], in light of feasibility and mea-
surement limitations. These findings show that
in most children's homes, the average level of
PbD is well below the current standards, mak-
ing it feasible to lower the current standards
and thus afford more protection for children.
