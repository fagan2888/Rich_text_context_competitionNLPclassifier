Background. Accumulating evidence suggests that physical activity may protect against the development of breast
cancer, but less is known about the role of modest physical activity during the postmenopausal years and in the context
of physical function.
Methods. We evaluated this association in the Iowa 65+ Rural Health Study, a population-based, prospective cohort
study of elderly adults. The cohort was linked to a population-based cancer registry for the years 1973--93, and the at-
risk cohort consisted of 1,806 women ages 65 to 102 years with an in-person baseline interview in 1982 and with no
documented cancer between 1973 and the baseline interview. Through 1993 (16,857 person-years of follow-up) there
were 46 incident cases of breast cancer.
Results. Greater level of physical activity in women with no physical disabilities was inversely associated with
breast cancer risk {p for trend = .01). Compared to inactive women with no physical disability, women reporting mod-
erate (age-adjusted relative risk [RR] = 0.5, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.3-1.1) or high (age-adjusted RR = 0.2,
95% CI .05-0.9) activity levels were at decreased risk of breast cancer. Women with any disability were also at
decreased risk of breast cancer compared to inactive women with no disability (age-adjusted RR = 0.4; 95% CI
0.2-0.9). Adjustment for education, body mass index, age at menarche, age at menopause, previous use of hormone
replacement therapy, pregnancy history, systolic blood pressure, smoking, and alcohol use did not alter these associa-
tions. In addition, these associations were similar after exclusion of cases occurring during the first two years of fol-
low-up, after adjusting for the number of doctor visits, and after stratifying by stage at diagnosis.
Conclusions. These data suggest that postmenopausal activity level, after accounting for physical disability, is
inversely associated with breast cancer risk.
THE American Cancer Society estimated that more than
180,000 women would be diagnosed with breast can-
cer in 1997 (1), of which approximately 50% would occur
in women age 65 years and older (2). The incidence rate for
breast cancer in women over the age of 65 is 444.7 per
100,000, which is over six times greater than the rate for
women under the age of 65, and the peak incidence rate of
483.9 per 100,000 for breast cancer occurs in the age group
75-79 years (2). There is accumulating epidemiologic data
that physical activity may be inversely associated with
breast cancer incidence (3-10) and mortality (11), with only
one study each showing either a positive (12) or null (13)
association. However, only five of these studies were able
to adjust adequately for the potential confounding effects of
known breast cancer risk factors (3,8-10,12), and most
studies have assessed physical activity either by participa-
tion in athletics in adolescence/early adulthood (3,10,13) or
by job activity during adulthood (5-7,11). Only three stud-
ies have evaluated the role of physical activity in the post-
menopausal years (4,9,12), and none has evaluated physical
activity in elderly women in the context of physical func-
tion, ignoring the fact that a large percentage of women
over age 65 may not be physically capable of engaging in
physical activity (14). We therefore evaluated the associa-
tion between postmenopausal physical activity in the con-
text of physical function and subsequent breast cancer risk
in a population-based cohort of elderly women.
METHODS
Study population.--In late 1981 and 1982, 80% of non-
institutionalized residents aged 65 years and older of Iowa
and Washington Counties, Iowa, were enrolled in the Iowa
65+ Rural Health Study (N = 3,673), which was one of the
four sites for the Established Populations for Epidemio-
logic Studies of the Elderly (EPESE) (15). These two coun-
ties are primarily rural with several small towns of popula-
tion less than 2,500. Of the 2,253 women enrolled into the
cohort, only the 1,942 women completing the full-form
baseline interview were eligible for inclusion in this report.
The full-form baseline interview, conducted in the respon-
dent's home by a trained interviewer, included questions on
a variety of demographic, health, and social characteristics,
as previously described (15).
Data collection.--Demographic characteristics included

age, number of years of education, and marital status. Par-
ticipants were asked about their menstrual history (age of
first menstruation, age at menopause, and type of meno-
pause), pregnancy history (ever pregnant, age at first preg-
nancy, and number of pregnancies), and prior use of hor-
mone replacement therapy. Height and weight at baseline
were self-reported, and body mass index (BMI) was calcu-
lated as weight (in kilograms [kg]) divided by height2 (in
meters [m]).
The physical activity measure integrated physical func-
tion and physical activity in order to assess physical activity
in the physically capable (see Table 1). Physical function
was assessed by self-report of ability to do heavy work
around the house, walk up and down a flight of stairs, or
walk a half mile without help; it was based on the Rosow-
Breslau Functional Health Scale (16). A woman was classi-
fied as disabled if she could not perform any one of the three
activities. Physical activity in physically capable women
(i.e., not disabled) was classified as inactive, moderately
active, or highly active, as previously reported (17). This
scale was based on the following five questions: "How often
do you: garden or do yardwork in season? do housework?
take walks? jog, bike ride, swim, or do other vigorous exer-
cise? play horseshoes/golf or play other moderate exercise
games in season?" Possible responses to each question
included: do not do, everyday, several times a week, once a
week, several times a month, and once a month or less.
Although we did not have information on activities not
related to recreation or home maintenance, only 3% of the
women were employed full-time at baseline interview.
Cohort follow-up.--Cohort members were contacted
annually either by telephone interviewers (follow-ups at 1,
2, 4, 5, and 7 years) or by in-person interviewers (follow-
ups at 3, 6, and 10 years) to update residence and vital sta-
tus. Vital status was also followed passively through moni-

toring of local obituary notices and state vital records, and
was known for all cohort members through the end of 1993.
The cancer experience of the cohort, except for non-
melanoma skin cancer, was ascertained by linking to the
State Health Registry of Iowa's cancer data base, which is
part of the National Cancer Institute's Surveillance, Epi-
demiology and End Results (SEER) program (2). The reg-
istry collects data including personal identifying informa-
tion, tumor site, morphology, and extent of disease on all
persons who were Iowa residents at the time of their diag-
nosis. Topographic and morphologic data were coded using
the International Classification of Diseases for Oncology
(ICD-O), 2nd edition (18). Linkage was conducted for the
years 1973 through 1993 and was based on a combination
of social security number, first, last, and maiden names,
date of birth, city and zip code.
Statistical analysis.--Of the 1,942 women who com-
pleted a full-form baseline interview, we excluded from
analysis women with any cancer detected in the cancer reg-
istry from 1973 to the baseline interview (n = 108), or who
additionally self-reported a breast cancer at any time prior
to baseline (n = 9). This approach is likely to have excluded
the vast majority of prevalent cancers (diagnosed after
1972) at study inception, as 90% of the women had lived in
their baseline community 10 years or longer. This approach
also decreased the reliance on lifetime self-report of cancer,
which is known to be of questionable validity in this
cohort. In addition, we excluded women who had no data
on physical function and physical activity (n = 19).
Because we could only ascertain cancers occurring in
Iowa residents, each woman was allocated person-years of
follow-up from the date of her baseline survey to the date
of breast cancer diagnosis (ICD-0 codes C50.0-C50.9),
date of emigration from Iowa, or date of death. If none of
these occurred, follow-up was through December 31, 1993.
Of the at-risk cohort of 1,806 women, 3.2% were censored
because of a move out of Iowa, and 39.6% were censored
because of death. Incidence rates were calculated by divid-
ing the number of events by the numbers of person-years of
follow-up for each category of physical activity. Relative
risks (RRs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) were
used as the measure of association, and were estimated
using Poisson regression (19).
RESULTS
There were 1,806 women with a mean age of 74.8 years
(range 65-102) who had no cancer in the cancer registry
between 1973 and their baseline interview, had no self-
report of a previous breast cancer, and had provided data on
physical activity and physical function. During 16,857 per-
son-years of follow-up (through 1993), there were 46 cases
of histologically confirmed breast cancer. The mean age at
diagnosis of the 46 cases was 80.1 years (range 70-90
years). Seventy-four percent of the cases had breast cancer
that was localized at diagnosis, and 26% had regional or
disseminated disease.
Approximately 39% of the cohort reported one or more
physical disabilities at baseline (Table 1). The remaining
women (i.e., with no physical disability) were categorized
POSTMENOPAUSAL PHYSICAL ACTIVITY AND BREAST CANCER M253
as highly active (10.1%), moderately active (30.2%), or
inactive (20.8%). The most common activity among active
women was walking, and the range of this activity was
thought to be very broad. Therefore, the active group was
divided into high versus moderate activity based on partici-
pation in vigorous sport or exercise to discriminate average
activity levels better (17). Of the women categorized as
highly active, 75% also reported walking at least weekly.
Breast cancer cases, compared to noncases, had a higher
mean weight, body mass index, and systolic blood pressure,
but were similar with respect to age, height, diastolic blood
pressure, and menstrual and reproductive history (Table 2).
There were no differences between cases and noncases with
respect to marital status, education, use of cigarettes or
alcohol, and number of doctor visits in the last year. In con-
trast, cases were more likely to have ever used hormone
replacement therapy and were less likely to engage in phys-
ical activity or be physically disabled.

risk factors by level of physical activity. Compared to inac-
tive women, women with a high level of physical activity
were on average 2.7 years younger, more highly educated,
more likely to be married, more likely to drink alcohol or to
have used hormone replacement therapy, and more likely to
have slightly lower systolic blood pressure. Women with a
moderate level of physical activity were similar in age, use
of hormone replacement therapy, and systolic blood pres-
sure compared to inactive women, but were less likely to
be married; level of education and use of alcohol were
intermediate between inactive and highly active women.
Women with any disability were in general older, least
likely to be married, had the highest systolic blood pres-
sure, and were more likely to have visited their doctor in
the past year. Across all groups, there was little difference
in smoking status, height, weight, body mass index, dia-
stolic blood pressure, mean age at menstruation, first preg-
nancy or menopause, and mean number of pregnancies.
We found an inverse association between level of physi-
cal activity in physically capable women and risk of breast
cancer (Table 4). Compared to inactive women, women
who engaged in moderate (age-adjusted RR = 0.5) or high
(age-adjusted RR = 0.2) levels of physical activity were at a
decreased risk of breast cancer (p for trend = .01). In addi-
tion, women with any disability were at decreased risk of
breast cancer compared to inactive women with no disabil-
ity (RR = 0.4; 95% CI 0.2-0.9). Adjustment for other breast
cancer risk factors in this data set, including education,
body mass index, age at menstruation, age at menopause,
use of hormone replacement therapy, and systolic blood
pressure did not alter these associations (Table 4, Model II).
Further adjustment for other potential breast cancer risk
factors, including smoking, alcohol use, age at first preg-
nancy, or number of pregnancies, also did not alter these
associations (data not shown).
To evaluate the possibility that subclinical breast cancer
might cause a decrease in physical activity, we excluded
breast cancer cases diagnosed during the first two years of
follow-up (n = 7); this had little effect on the relative risk
estimates (Table 4, Model III). Another concern was whether
a detection bias might explain these data; that is, women in a
certain activity level may have been more likely to have
their breast cancer detected earlier due to closer medical
surveillance. However, further adjustment of the full model
for number of doctor visits in the last year did not materially
affect the associations (Table 4, Model IV). In addition, we
stratified the outcome into localized versus regional or dis-
seminated breast cancer at diagnosis, and refit separate mod-
els (Table 4, Models V and VI, respectively). Because there
were only 12 cases with regional or disseminated disease at
diagnosis, study power was limited; nevertheless, the results
suggest an inverse association with physical activity regard-
less of stage at diagnosis.
DISCUSSION
We observed an inverse dose-response relation between
increasing levels of postmenopausal physical activity in
physically capable women and subsequent breast cancer
risk, which was not altered after multivariate adjustment for
major breast cancer risk factors. Women with any physical

disability were also at decreased risk of breast cancer com-
pared to inactive, physically capable women. There was lit-
tle evidence that these results were strongly influenced by
subclinical disease or a detection bias. To our knowledge,
the postmenopausal physical activity and breast cancer
association has not been evaluated in the context of physi-
cal function. While physical disability is not a major issue
in younger or middle-aged populations, it is clearly an
important consideration for elderly women in whom the
prevalence is high (14).
Our findings are consistent with the accumulating epi-
demiologic data that physical activity may be inversely
associated with breast cancer incidence (3-10). However,
physical activity in the postmenopausal years has been eval-
uated in only three studies (4,9,12). Albanes and colleagues
(4) reported an association between breast cancer risk and
nonrecreational activity (RR =1.5 for least active vs quite
active; 95% CI 0.7-2.8) and recreational activity (RR = 1.7
for little or no exercise vs much exercise; 95% CI 0.8-2.9)
in postmenopausal women. Friedenreich and Rohan (9)
reported an inverse association between total weekly physi-
cal activity and breast cancer risk in postmenopausal
women (OR = 0.7 for > 4,000 kcal/week vs 0 kcal/week;
95% CI 0.4-1.2). In contrast, Dorgan and colleagues (12),
using the Framingham study, found a positive association
between level of total physical activity at the 1954 biennial
exam (median age 50 years) and breast cancer risk (91%
postmenopausal) through 1984 (RR = 1.6 for highest quar-
tile vs lowest quartile of physical activity; 95% CI 0.9-2.9).
The exact mechanism by which physical activity might
influence breast cancer risk is not known, but the most com-
monly hypothesized mechanisms have focused on the modu-
lation of endogenous sex steroid hormones by physical activ-
ity either through direct effects on the menstrual cycle (e.g.,
age at menarche, anovulation, or age at menopause) or
through effects on body weight (20). However, neither of
these mechanisms is particularly satisfying in explaining our
data. Physical activity levels in this cohort were overall very
moderate and are unlikely to be a significant determinant of
body weight for the majority of women. Physical activity can
obviously no longer directly influence the menstrual cycle in
postmenopausal women, although it could impact steroid hor-
mone levels through other mechanisms. Higher levels of post-
menopausal physical activity could reflect higher activity lev-
els in adolescence or adulthood, and therefore might represent
the continued long-term protection due to hormonal modula-

IIDue to small numbers, the moderate and high categories were combined.
tion in the premenopausal decades, which is consistent with
some epidemiologic data (5,6). Unfortunately we do not have
any data to directly test this hypothesis in our cohort. How-
ever, Dorgan et al. (12) observed in the Framingham cohort a
correlation between physical activity level at examination 4
and examination 12 (16 years later) of only .18 for women,
suggesting considerable shift in activity levels over time.
An alternative, and less explored, mechanism may be the
modulation of insulin sensitivity by physical activity. There
is increasing evidence that insulin may play a role in the eti-
ology of breast cancer (21), in part because insulin is an
important growth factor for human breast cancer cells cul-
tured in vitro and it influences breast cancer cell cycle
kinetics. Insulin can also cross-react with the IGF-I receptor
as well as increase the bioavailability of IGF-I, and IGF-I
itself has been implicated in breast cancer (21). Levels of
serum C-peptide (a surrogate measure of insulin level) have
been reported to be significantly higher in breast cancer
cases compared to controls (22). Small variations in physi-
cal activity in untrained individuals appear to affect marked
changes in the metabolic activity of skeletal muscle (23).
Exercise training programs are associated with improved
insulin action (and lower insulin levels) in trained athletes
(23). This association extends to much more modest physi-
cal activity in untrained individuals and appears to be inde-
pendent of age and level of obesity (24-25), although there
are fewer data for women and the associations are often less
striking than those reported for men. This hypothesis is
appealing because it provides a physiologic basis that could
account for a protective effect of modest postmenopausal
physical activity against breast cancer.
It is not clear why women with any physical disability on
the Rosow-Breslau Functional Health Scale would be at
decreased risk of breast cancer, and this finding needs to be

replicated before drawing any conclusions. Women in this
group are known to be diverse in terms of the causes of their
physical disability, length of their disability, and the pres-
ence of comorbidity, and many are likely to be no longer
disabled within a relatively short period of time (14). Recent
data suggest that women with a history of wrist (26) or hip
fracture (27) or lower bone mass (28,29) have a reduced risk
of breast cancer. While osteoporosis and fracture are rela-
tively common causes of disability in elderly women, we
did not have data on the cause or length of the disability, and
thus cannot assess the direct relevance to our finding.
These data are obviously limited by the small number of
incident breast cancers and the lack of data on physical activ-
ity during adolescence or adulthood, family history of breast
cancer, body fat distribution, and diet. While we attempted to
control for medical surveillance for breast cancer by adjust-
ing for the number of doctor visits in the last year, this does
not directly address confounding by mammography or breast
self-examination screening activities. However, the inverse
association between physical activity and breast cancer
remained after stratifying by stage at diagnosis, suggesting
that this was unlikely to be a strong bias. Our physical activ-
ity measure has not been validated; it is inversely associated
with total mortality and functional decline over 3 and 6 years
of follow-up in this cohort (17). There are many strengths to
this study including the population-based prospective design,
high participation rate, complete follow-up, use of a SEER
cancer registry to ascertain breast cancer diagnoses, in-per-
son interviews, assessment of the presence of physical dis-
abilities, measurement of both recreational and home mainte-
nance physical activity, and control for many of the major
known breast cancer risk factors.
In summary, we found an inverse association between
level of postmenopausal physical activity in physically capa-
ble older women and risk of breast cancer. The biologic
underpinning to this finding is not known, but plausibly could
be related to the improved insulin sensitivity that occurs with
modest levels of physical activity. This hypothesis warrants
further consideration, as it may have implications for the pri-
mary prevention of breast cancer in elderly women.
