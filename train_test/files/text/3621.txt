Article
In modern Western society, people's feelings about death are
complex. In 1915, Freud said that nobody believes in their
own death and human beings avoid broaching the subject with
someone nearing death. However, death is the oldest reality
shared by all of humankind and is the only thing of which all
humans can be certain. Many thinkers have considered the
evolution of representations of death throughout time, as seen
in the work of Gorer (1955), Morin (1970), Ariès (1975),
Thomas (1975), Vovelle (1983), and others in the past decades.
Attitudes to death have profoundly changed in the last cen-
turies, as have the associated social representations--cultural
productions that facilitate our comprehension of social phe-
nomena (Ariès, 1975; Kellehear, 2007; Morin, 1970). Morin
(1970) referred to it as the crisis of death. According to Ariès
(1975), from the Middle Ages to the first half of the 19th cen-
tury, people were on more familiar terms with death and
dying. There was a collective notion of destiny in which death
was accepted as part of life. The dying process was a public
event in which family, friends, neighbors, and children would
gather and everyone knew their role. Death was seen as a bio-
logical phenomenon manifested by a series of natural signals
known by the dying (Ariès, 1975). Death occurred when there
was a complete and irrevocable cessation of vital functions.
The integration of religion into activities of daily life also
influenced attitudes and representations of death. The dying
would place themselves in God's hands. For the family, death
was God's will (Ariès, 1975) and the soul became immortal
(Morin, 1970). However, the combined impact of medical
advances, the decline of religion, the affirmation of the indi-
vidual, and the value placed on individual autonomy have
dramatically altered our relationship with death (Ariès, 1975;
Larouche, 1991). There is an urgent desire to defeat death
and disease, which is thought to be evidence of the failure of
Western medicine to maintain youth and health (Clavandier,
2009; Hintermeyer, 2010).
These changes are also evident in the process of dying. In
today's society, death usually takes place in care institutions
(Statistique Canada, 2012; Timmermans, 2005), even when the
person has lived at home throughout the course of his or her ill-
ness. Biomedical practices shape our understanding of the
parameters of death (Kaufman & Morgan, 2005) and how we
recognize the end of life (Glaser, Strauss, & Anselm, 1966;
Mino, 2013; Sudnow, 1967). Death is no longer the inevitable
consequence of illness and old age, but the result of a series of
medical decisions (Kaufman, 2000; Zimmermann, 2007). The

Family Caregivers' Social Representations
of Death in a Palliative Care Context
Sabrina Lessard1, Bernard-Simon Leclerc1,
and Suzanne Mongeau2
Abstract
The objective of this study was to consider the social representations of death of family caregivers in a palliative care context.
The authors focused on the analysis of 23 interviews with family caregivers who cared for a terminally ill person at home and/
or in a specialized palliative care unit, in Québec, Canada. The finding showed that family caregivers had different images that
specifically represented death: (a) losses as different kinds of "deaths," (b) palliative care as a place to negotiate with death,
and (c) last times as confirmation of the end. These images highlight the meaning attributed to the body and the position of
the dying person in our Western society. Representations of palliative care reveal a kind of paradox, a place of respect and
of "gentle death," and a place where death is almost too omnipresent. They also show the strong beliefs surrounding the
use of painkillers at the end of life. Finally, these images refer to end-of-life personal rituals viewed as support for the passage
into a new state of being. This study provides a better understanding of the common sense of death for family caregivers in
a palliative care context and of the meanings of this emotional subject.

process unfolds in stages, sometimes making it difficult to rec-
ognize death when it actually comes, with the loss of conscious-
ness or the cessation of vital functions (Clavandier, 2009).
Death and medical assistance for the dying are important
concerns in contemporary social and political spheres, as
shown by a recent public consultation on Bill 52 in Québec,
Canada, held by the Select Committee on Dying with Dignity
(2012), which resulted in passage of the Act Respecting End-
of-Life Care in June 2014 (scheduled to come into force in
December 2015). The right to receive palliative care and
medical aid in dying is the central theme of this legislation.
Today, family members who care for a loved one are gener-
ally known as "family caregivers," a concept developed in
recent decades within a specific context. The concept became
entrenched in the wake of the "ambulatory shift" reform, med-
ical advances, increased life expectancy, and the existence of
chronic illnesses that vested the family caregiver with a new
level of responsibility for a sick loved one that can extend over
many years, until the person's death (Wierzbowski, 2008).
The palliative care approach emerged in the late 1960s,
and diverse health institutions set up the practice of this new
area of care (Hintermeyer, 2010). Palliative care has under-
lined the importance of easing pain and suffering in the dying
process. For Rossi (2010), the palliative approach can be
seen as a collective response to the fear of death. In relation
to these observations, what are family caregivers' social rep-
resentations of death after the experience of accompanying a
dying loved one in a palliative care context? The aim of this
article is to explore the social representations of death of
bereaved family caregivers.
Few studies have been done on the social representations of
professionals (Bellavance, 2011; Bernard, 2009; Dany, Marie,
& Salas, 2007; Dany, Rousset, Salas, Duffaud, & Favre, 2009;
Maresca et al., 2004; Salas et al., 2008) and the experience of
patients (Lawton, 2002) and the general public (D'Hérouville,
2010) with regard to palliative care, cancer, and the elderly in
society (Cannone et al., 2004; Lalive d'Epinay, 1995; Marie,
Dany, Cannone, Dudoit, & Duffaud, 2010). To our knowl-
edge, no study has been undertaken on the specific social rep-
resentations of death of family caregivers in a palliative care
context. Considering the literature, we think this study is par-
ticularly relevant to two fields of interest. First, from a scien-
tific perspective, the study of social representations can help
provide a better understanding of the common sense of death
for family caregivers in a palliative care context. Second, try-
ing to understand different meanings can help to improve the
practices of professionals who care for dying patients. Death is
an emotional subject; it generates emotional reactions that can
affect behavior and the mourning process.
The Concept of Social Representations
Often used in social sciences, social representations refer to a
variety of meanings, boundaries, and definitions (Mannoni,
2010). They are defined as an organized structure of beliefs,
opinions, attitudes, images, and information constructed around
a specific object (Abric, 2003; Jodelet, 1989; Seca, 2010),
which help humans understand the world, and guide actions
and behaviors (Mannoni, 2010). They are an instrument of
communication. Representations are part of an individual's
universe and are constructed through interaction with others
(Bellavance, 2011). As reported by Doise (Doise & Palmonari,
1986) and Mannoni (Mannoni, 2010), images associated with
meaning are aspects of social representations. Each image is
linked to a meaning, and each meaning is linked to an image.
Their function is to transform an unusual phenomenon into a
familiar one (Jodelet, 1989). They help to explain reality (Doise
& Palmonari, 1986; Jodelet, 1989; Moscovici, 1989).
According to Seca (2010), representations take form and grow
in daily conversation and are associated with specific situa-
tions. The relationship to others and to the world is then modi-
fied (Jodelet, 1989). Social representations are studied to learn
a group's common sense of a specific context. The representa-
tions of death in palliative care generate images. The core ele-
ments of these representations generate the most commonly
expressed images (Moliner, 2008). They are commonly used to
describe and understand their inherent meanings. They are
essential to understanding emotionally charged topics such as
death and palliative care (Bellavance, 2011).
Materials and Method
The data used for this article were initially gathered for an
earlier study (forthcoming) conducted in an integrated uni-
versity health and social services center (CIUSSS) in the
north of Montréal to assess the needs of family caregivers
and services provided to end-of-life patients in palliative
care. Family caregivers spoke spontaneously about their
experiences, evoking powerful images of what death repre-
sented for them. We decided to proceed with a secondary
analysis of the data to explore the social representations of
death of family caregivers in a palliative care context.
The initial study used a mixed-methods design that drew on
data from different sources (family caregivers and profession-
als, semi-structured interviews, a cross-sectional survey, and
medical databases) but, for the purpose of this study, we focused
only on an analysis of 23 interviews with family caregivers who
had cared for a terminally ill person at home and/or in a special-
ized palliative care unit (only one person died at home).
Caregivers were initially selected according to the follow-
ing criteria: (a) has benefited from palliative care services at
home and/or in the specialized palliative care unit in the ter-
ritory of the CIUSSS, (b) is the principal caregiver in the
patient's medical records, (c) has taken care of the terminally
ill person in the last 3 to 6 months, and (d) is willing to par-
ticipate in a face-to-face interview. The first authors con-
tacted them by phone before meeting with them. Eighteen
women and five men participated between December 2012
and February 2013: spouses (10), children (seven), sisters
(four), niece (one), and son-in-law (one).
Lessard et al. 3
An open-ended interview guide was developed with several
relevant sections: evolution of the disease, experience with care
and death, experience with palliative care services, needs of
caregivers, social and cultural aspects of support, both given
and received, and interaction with the formal and informal net-
work. The interviews were conducted by a research officer and
anthropologist (first author), at the caregiver's chosen loca-
tion--home, café, or a private room in the CIUSSS. Interviews
were done in French or English and lasted from 30 to 120 min
(Lessard, Leclerc, & Mongeau, 2014). All interviews were
recorded (with written consent) and transcribed.
The study was approved by the executive director of the
institution and conducted in accordance with the provincial
health and social services act and the ethical standards of the
university institution (Leclerc et al., 2014; Ministère de la
santé et des services sociaux [MSSS], 2007). Participants
were clearly informed that their participation was voluntary
and anonymity was preserved.
Data Analysis
We used a qualitative thematic analysis to enhance the under-
standing of the family caregivers' social representations of
death. Using QDAMiner Software, we examined the materi-
als by breaking the interviews into small units of categories
(Negura, 2006) focused on social representations of death
(Vaismoradi, Turunen, & Bondas, 2013). As empirical stud-
ies on our subject are poorly documented, we used an induc-
tive open manner to identify different images representing
death. The thematic analysis provided us with an overview of
the data within the specific context (Vaismoradi et al., 2013)
of palliative care. The first author analyzed the content of
each interview, and the other two authors validated the results
in several consultation sessions. The images reported by
interviewees emphasized the meaning of the social represen-
tations of death expressed by the family caregivers.
Qualitative coding underlined family caregivers' social rep-
resentations of death and those of the person they cared for
through the end-of-life process.
Results
The analysis of the interviews showed that family caregivers
had different images that specifically represented death. The
images are personal, but together, they reveal a common sense
of death in the palliative care context. We grouped the images
into three separate categories: (a) losses as different kinds of
"deaths," (b) palliative care unit as a place to negotiate with
death, and (c) last times as confirmation of the end. These differ-
ent images represent non-linear steps in the end-of-life process,
but they were all lived in a palliative care context (Table 1).
Losses as Different Kinds of "Deaths"
Family caregivers reported that the care process occurs over
a period punctuated by major changes, all associated with
losses. They happen at different points during the illness.
Each of the following images was linked with death and was
significant for the dying person and/or for the caregiver.
Failing bodies. The interviews show how the transformation of
the physical body is associated with death. The family care-
givers described the deterioration of the person's physical
condition. This was often a slow process, lasting from hours
to months, depending on the type and stage of the disease, but
with the constant awareness of the imminence of the ultimate
loss. Disturbing images were associated with the deteriora-
tion of the body. A caregiver described her feelings about her
sister when she realized she could not stand up anymore.
I found it difficult, when she was not able to get up anymore.
She was bedridden and always asleep. I found it rough. It was
the announcement of the beginning of the end. So it slaps you in
the face.
A daughter explained one of the last mental images she
had of her mother
Sometimes, I have this image in my head. The swollen chest, the
mouth wide open and her despairing eyes. I had never seen eyes
like this.And this, it hit me, the ears were glued to her head. That
meant not a lot of time left to live.
Another woman mentioned that her mother compared her
body with a puzzle falling apart:
In the morning, she told me, "It is true my daughter, it is today
that I am leaving." She told me: "it is as if my body was falling
apart, it leaves me. It is like a puzzle." At one point, she had two
mouths, three stomachs. And she wasn't on morphine.
The significance of these different images was clear for
these women; the deterioration of the body was directly

linked to the arrival of death. For some of them, these images
will remain in their minds long after their loved one's death.
Social death. Family caregivers described how their loved one
suffered due to the loss of belongings or social status for which
they had worked all their lives. Their exclusion was dual in
nature, experienced in terms of their perception of themselves
and the perception of others. The image of the loss of them-
selves was clearly associated with the end. At this point, they
felt the loss of their social status. A spouse described how her
husband's physical condition affected his job:
He had injuries around his nose . . . At that point, she (their boss)
called me and told me: "I am sorry but I am obliged to tell you
that you can't come and do your show anymore because the
residents are in shock from seeing Roger (her sick husband) in
this condition."
Another caregiver described her mother's feelings about
her belongings as she lived through the last stage of her life:
That's what she told me: "My daughter, I have no control over
my life anymore. I have no car anymore, no house anymore, no
more projects, I have nothing left except my head." Her goal
was to keep her mind as long as possible.
The image of dispossession is a strong one.
Vanishing quality of life. This image spoke to the relationship
between quality of life and death. Many family caregivers
spoke about this. For some people, the loss of quality of life
meant acceptance of the dying process. Some of those who
were dying had no hope their condition would improve and
wanted the situation to stop. They associated it with their life
coming to an end. Two daughters reported their respective
mother's speech near the end:
When she had her heart attack, she shouldn't . . . she wasn't to
go back home. Her quality of life was gone. She said to us
"There is no quality of life for me, and there won't be any in the
future. I will go from one hospital to another." At that point, she
decided to stop everything (treatment).
She used to say: "I have no more quality of life, it is crap. I am
no longer able to stand up anymore and to go pee by myself. I
can't live in such conditions" . . . She was sick, she had no more
quality of life and it was her choice, she pushed to end it. She
wasn't scared.
Transformation of the loved one. When an ill person undergoes
a major change in their behavior, this is evoked by the image
of the transformation of the loved one. The behaviors induced
by the end-of-life process deeply affected some family care-
givers who felt they could barely recognize the "new" loved
one. For one husband, he experienced his first real loss when
he saw the transformation of his wife's behavior. The person
he used to know, at that point, was gone. "All her gentleness,
she lost her gentleness . . . She was a really gentle and sweet
person. She began to die before dying. And I couldn't do
anything. It was difficult."
Break in the bond of communication.This representation
occurred during the end-of-life process, and therefore, some
family caregivers felt the real loss when their loved one went
into a coma, before the person's actual death. The image of a
broken bond of communication represented the end. The loss
of consciousness was viewed as the irremediable end of
communication with the loved one. A daughter described her
sense of loss when she realized that her mother was about to
lose her mind:
I can say that the most difficult moment was when the link
broke, when my mother said "my daughter, it is true, I am
leaving." And then, the relationship stopped with my mother. I
found it so difficult not being able to communicate with her
anymore.
Palliative Care Unit as a Place to Negotiate With
Death
Interview respondents reported different representations of
the palliative care unit, confirming the personal meaning of
palliative care. For all of them, the palliative care unit was a
place of great service, and at the same time, it represented the
arrival of death. They referred to different images.
Palliative care unit as the last home. On one hand, family care-
givers see palliative care services as a release from the
responsibility of caring for their loved one. At the same time,
it confirmed the reality of approaching death. The act of
moving from home to the palliative care unit was experi-
enced by family caregivers as a moment when they were
confronted with the end. For many, the palliative care unit
was seen as "the last home," "the end." A spouse expressed
how she experienced the departure of her husband from their
family home to the palliative care unit:
I heard a lot about the palliative care unit. That it was really nice.
I can confirm it, it was really nice. When they arrive (ill person)
at that stage, there is a kind of detachment . . . When he left in
the ambulance, he knew he was not coming back, it was really
emotional.
This departure was also experienced as a failure by some
family caregivers, and the care unit seemed to represent a
place of death. They judged themselves as having failed in
caring for their relative. This was especially true when the
stay in the unit was too short for them to appreciate the pal-
liative approach offered by the professionals.
I could have had some great moments. The only image I have
left, is of my wife making a grimace while receiving a shot from
Lessard et al. 5
the nurse. It is the last vital sign I remember. She was at the
palliative care unit for three days.
As mentioned above, the palliative care unit was associ-
ated with both attentive care and death. It was difficult for
family caregivers to hide the end-of-life process from their
loved one, especially when the subject had been avoided.
The image of death remained engraved in the mind. A son
explained how he dealt with hiding the situation from his
father, because it was so strongly associated with death.
I pretended like palliative care was just like this but he knew
what it meant, palliative care. "You, you won't die. Forget it, the
doctor only signed for you to get a room and look at the services
you get." He played the game with me. But at one point, there
were people dying next to him . . . I found it rough.
Death comes wrapped in a white cloth.A strong image of
death represented in palliative care is that of the dead
wrapped in a white cloth. Family caregivers often expressed
acceptance of the arrival of death. However, the analysis
showed that seeing people dying in the palliative care unit
confronted them directly with the reality. Many of the family
caregivers mentioned the negative effect on their morale of
knowing and seeing people dying close by. Death was too
close. A daughter spoke of finding out that nine people died
in one night at the palliative care unit. "There are 12 bed-
rooms, only three were still occupied. Over the night, nine . . .
God, it gives you a slap in the face!" A husband stressed his
discomfort with the fact that his wife was aware of the death
of others around her:
There is only one thing that was hard. I don't know if they can
do something to improve the situation. When there is a new
person who arrives (ill person in the palliative care unit), they
should put them in a wing for people more in shape . . . Once,
she (his wife) said hello to someone, and the day after, he was
covered up dead. There were three who died during her stay . . .
Once, she saw somebody who just died. The effect this had on
her . . . two days later there was another. Whatever, I don't know,
I speak on her behalf even if she knew why she was there.
The goodbye injection. The interviews showed that palliative
care was viewed as a way of dying without extreme physical
suffering. "That's why we lived at the palliative care unit,
these were palliative care services because you feel and
observe all the medical assistance for physical and physio-
logical well-being." "I can say that she did not suffer. At the
unit, each time a professional saw her in pain, they gave her
an injection."
However, there was a strong representation shared by
family caregivers of the "goodbye injection." The painkiller
injection was viewed as a medical act to ease pain and induce
death, especially when the ill person fell into a semi-coma
and then died. They reported having accepted medical care to
relieve the pain, and some of them felt guilty after having
accepted such care. Here are a few of the quotes expressed
by different family caregivers. "The hardest moment was
when I realized what I'd said yes for; the perfusion to relieve
the psychological distress. It was the goodbye injection."
The doctor gave his authorization to put her in a deep coma . . .
I thought it was a natural process, that it was the natural
evolution. "She has been getting shots," everybody said. OK
fine, stop telling me, now I know.
Other family caregivers mentioned witnessing the normal
course of the dying process. They explained the necessity of
the pain medication and its link with the dying process. "And
then, they started to give morphine on Wednesday. The
Friday around noon, he had his injection and he fell asleep. It
was finished, he died at midnight."
The injection, for others, seemed to be a way to shorten
the dying process:
Until her last moment when she was able to communicate,
especially the very last moment, she found it really long. She
was looking forward to the end . . . My sister tried to influence
the formal caregivers to increase the morphine doses or I don't
know what . . . even if she was ready to die, at one point, she
didn't have any control on her thoughts, her body strived. It
wanted to stay, survival instinct.
Last Times as Confirmation of the End
The end-of-life process was reported to be associated with
different ways of saying goodbye. Family caregivers spoke
about their experiences with their relative while approaching
the end. Their different actions or behaviors were a kind of
ritual surrounding death, and they were linked to images.
Last time.Mostly, family caregivers reported having orga-
nized a last get-together for their loved one with family and
friends. The event was a moment to say good things about the
past and wishes for the future. It was a chance to give the sick
person pleasure and see he or she had everything he or she
wanted. Family caregivers experienced different last moments.
I knew how to please her for her birthday . . . party hat for the
mother, big strawberry shortcake, she was happy. Because
everybody knew it was her last birthday, she knew it as well. We
took pictures and had cake.
For others, it was an opportunity to say goodbye
My mother used to call her people to say goodbye . . . She called
her friends and told them, "I just want to say that I am at the
hospital and that I am leaving. I wanted to say goodbye."
A spouse explained how the ritual continued once her
husband died as a way to accompany him. It was the first step
in the memory of the living.
6 SAGE Open
We put some candles in the bedroom and classic music that he
used to like. My son-in-law got a bottle of wine and gave us a
full glass and "cheers" . . . It was OK, it was a kind of closure.
Death conversation. The image of the death conversation was
omnipresent in the interviews. Family caregivers reported
that it was difficult to speak directly of death. They told us
how uncomfortable they were about broaching the death
conversation with their loved one. Many of them then felt
sorry they had avoided the subject. We explored different
ways of approaching the death conversation, for instance, to
plan funerals and other logistical issues with the dying
person.
We had made her will. We had the talk but she counted on me, it
was to my discretion because she had difficulty talking about
death. She was really scared . . . When we talked about death or
that she knew that she was about to die, she used to get upset.
We also observed that some family caregivers saw the
death conversation as an overly strong representation of
death to the point it became a taboo subject. Some decided to
take the opposite stance and evoke a positive vision of future
health conditions. They said they did this to protect their
loved one.
She was so scared to die. We did not . . . I did not talk about
death with her. However, I tried to encourage her, to tell her that
she would get better. She would feel better, maybe tomorrow she
would feel better still. But . . . how long can we lie to try to
change the patient's vision? At one point, she couldn't get up.
So, it was just to say that we were there for her and that it was to
be for the best.
Respondents also emphasized the difficulty of communi-
cating with a dying person. One caregiver reported he
retreated into silence while trying to talk with his wife. He
did not know what to talk about with her. The past, the future,
or everyday conversation was not an option for him. He
adopted the silence of death.
In the last months, I was not able to talk anymore. Luckily, my
sister-in-law was there to listen to her. Me, I was unable to do so.
The kids used to tell me, "Talk to her, talk to her." I told her, "I
will always love you." It was the only thing I had to say.
The same man mentioned in the interview how he would
have liked professional accompaniment to face the difficult
situation. For him, the death conversation would have been
an important moment.
I learned something afterward. A friend of mine told me that
when he was caring for his wife, they had access to a social
worker. He (the social worker) talked with both of them, to the
wife and to the husband. He made them ready for death. I think
I would have loved to have that. It would have opened us up to
talk about it. We didn't talk about it at all.
Call of death.Finally, family caregivers reported how they
experienced the arrival of death. Many of them knew it was
coming as they observed their loved one feeling and seeing
death approach. The sick person's feelings were shared in
different ways. A spouse described it like this:
The last day he was mentally with us, the Easter Saturday. He
died the next Wednesday. During that day he began to say that
his brother was coming. "Peter is coming, Peter is coming."
Peter was his brother, who passed away many years ago. So
then, I knew that it was coming. When we begin to see dead
people, it was because we are engaged in that path.
Discussion
Social representations on the subject of death have been
abundant over the years, from historical (Ariès, 1975;
Vovelle, 1983), sociological (Morin, 1970), and anthropo-
logical (Gorer, 1955; Thomas, 1975) perspectives. Based on
empirical data, this study provides new knowledge about
social representations of death in a palliative care context.
The article presents images spontaneously created by the
caregivers themselves that illustrate their vision of death.
Using a qualitative thematic analysis, we identified certain
images and the common sense that was ascribed to them. In
all, we came up with three main groups of typical images: (a)
losses as different kinds of "deaths," (b) palliative care unit
as a place to negotiate with death, and (c) last times as a con-
firmation of the end.
It seemed appropriate to highlight the strongest images in
social representations and to link them with the current social
context. Our study distinguishes itself in two ways: the sub-
jects that were studied (family caregivers) and the context of
the study (palliative care). Both of these particularities are
characteristic of our unique contemporary situation.
Images of loss such as the failing body, the social death,
and vanishing quality of life refer directly to the end of exis-
tence and a person's death even before the person's physical
death has occurred. These images highlight the meaning
attributed to the body and the position of the dying person in
contemporary society (Clavandier, 2009; Le Breton, 1992).
As a social object, the body is a key element of our identity
(Clarke, Griffin, & Team, 2008), acting as a mirror that con-
veys information about a person, and based on which others
and the person herself or himself form judgments. The body
is usually the focus of health, well-being, youth, and fitness
that must be maintained. It is therefore not surprising that
when the body of a sick person begins to deteriorate and their
appearance transforms into something that contrasts with the
ideals of health and beauty, the sick person feels excluded and
family caregivers begin to evoke the approach of death. This
social death (Lawton, 2002) occurring before the person's
physical death refers to the position of the dying person in our
society, an ambiguous position because the sick person no
longer really belongs to the category of the living, but neither
is she or he in the category of the dead (Clavandier, 2009).
Lessard et al. 7
Our data revealed that powerful images are representing
palliative care. They evoke a place permeated by respect and an
approach focused on reducing the physical suffering caused by
a life that is on the wane. The sick no longer die suffering intol-
erable pain. Palliative care may also, however, represent death;
family caregivers described the image of the last place the
loved one would live, and that of the dead person wrapped in a
white cloth--the omnipresence of death around them. The pal-
liative care unit is also the place where death is accelerated and
where family caregivers mistook the soothing of pain through
the administration of a painkiller (usually refers to morphine)
with the "goodbye" injection. The possibility of hastening
death may be strongly associated with the easing of suffering.
This representation generates genuine confusion among family
caregivers, and some felt responsible for the death of their
loved one. The use of morphine and other medications to ease
patients' suffering can alter their consciousness. This explains
the loss of consciousness or "deep coma" reported by some of
the caregivers. However, the literature on the subject tells us
that the administration of pain medication neither hastens nor
delays death (Rurup, Borgsteede, van der Heide, van der Maas,
& Onwuteaka-Philipsen, 2009; Rurup et al., 2010). This repre-
sentation may also be explained by the extensive media cover-
age of the National Assembly of Québec's public hearings on
dying with dignity. Medical aid in dying, euthanasia, and
assisted suicide have become the subject of a broad public
debate among Quebecers (Leclerc et al., 2014; Simard, 2013).
In light of these results, representations of palliative care reveal
a kind of paradox, a place of respect and a "gentle death," and
a place where death is almost too omnipresent.
Family caregivers also spoke of images they associated
with end-of-life rituals such as the person's last moments, the
"death conversation," and the "call of death." Death is a
defining moment, in which relational dynamics have a major
impact, both on the person who is dying and on the bereaved
and the grieving process. The findings of our analysis show
that end-of-life rituals are individual and personal. They are
conducted in private and most often only involve the family
and immediate circle. This observation echoes a point
recently raised in the literature: Despite the individualized
practices that have replaced traditional rites, individuals still,
and will always, turn to rites in these circumstances
(Bussières, 2009; Clavandier, 2009). Rites can be viewed as
support for the passage into a new state of being. They can
also be seen as a means of dealing with the anguish of loss.
Various representations of death are associated with a rup-
ture or change in the nature of communication with a loved
one. The break in the bond of communication happens when
the person goes into a coma or undergoes a behavior change,
or when silence sets in because the caregiver sees no possi-
bility of a future with his or her loved one. The comments of
Le Breton (2004) concerning the imperative of communica-
tion in our era highlight the feelings of unease or anxiety felt
by family caregivers when they can no longer communicate
with the sick person approaching death. In light of Le
Breton's (1992) remarks, we might well consider whether
this anxiety is not a product of Western society, which pro-
motes and creates the expectation of dialogue in all phases of
life. Some of the caregivers who participated in our study
reported that their loved ones did not recognize their impend-
ing death although they were in a palliative care setting and
their caregivers had been informed of the situation. Glaser
and colleagues (1966) have described the mutual pretence as
a "closed awareness" context. These caregivers believed that
their loved ones did not wish to know they were dying.
We believe it is important to examine the usefulness of these
representations for front-line practice and interventions. A con-
sideration of the different social representations of death could
give health practitioners a fuller understanding of the attitudes
of family caregivers and the diverse logic underpinning their
actions. In this respect, our findings have highlighted the oper-
ating logic of family caregivers as not necessarily exclusively
rational, but also rooted in the symbolic, relational, and emo-
tional registers. The findings underline the importance of con-
tinuing public information and education regarding the use of
morphine. Some family caregivers associated the injection of
morphine with the arrival of death, which caused them to feel
guilt and frustration. The beliefs surrounding the use of mor-
phine and other pain-relieving medication at the end of life are
numerous and appear to persist over time despite public aware-
ness activities by health care organizations. The numerous
deaths that occur in palliative care units remind family caregiv-
ers of approaching death in a manner that is almost brutal. We
believe it would be appropriate to consider whether the reac-
tions to these deaths might serve as a lever for addressing
anguish about death and fears about the future (Arnault, 2004).
Last, the representations associated with ruptures of communi-
cation may be alleviated somewhat through professional sup-
port in the form of mediators or facilitators to help the family
and their loved one (Arnault, 2004). When the person who is
dying goes into a coma and the communicational bond appears
to be broken, professionals can use this as an opportunity to
encourage the family caregiver to communicate using other
means than words.
This qualitative study is still exploratory in nature, and
results cannot be generalized to other contexts, cultures, or
eras. A qualitative study does not generally seek to extrapo-
late the findings to the population in general, but rather aims
to further investigate and better understand the phenomenon
under study. This research describes the social representa-
tions of a culturally homogenous group, in other words, most
of the individuals interviewed were born in Canada.
Considering the increasingly multicultural character of
Montréal, and Québec in general, it is essential to consider,
for further research, this subject with individuals of various
backgrounds, beliefs, and cultures. Studies on family care-
givers' social representations of death in different contexts,
such as long-term care facilities, could further contribute to
our knowledge, given that all those who live in these centers
spend their last moments of life there (Leclerc et al., 2014).
