of Cognitive Function by Race or Ethnicity

This study examined racial or ethnic differences in cognitive function, cross-sectionally and longitudinally, using
survey data from the Asset and Health Dynamics Among the Oldest Old. A version of the Telephone Interview for
Cognitive Status (TICS), proxy assessments of cognition, and difficulties in performing daily tasks were assessed.
Blacks performed below Whites on the TICS at baseline and on proxy assessments of cognition. TICS score
declined with age for Whites and Blacks, with some relative gains for Blacks. At baseline, Blacks more often had
difficulties in performing daily tasks, with some increase in difficulties relative to Whites with age. Differences
between other groups and Whites were smaller than those between Blacks and Whites.
DECLINING cognitive function is a determinant of several
unfavorable outcomes among elderly individuals, in-
cluding increases in limitations in activities of daily living
(ADLs; Fillenbaum, Peterson, Welsh-Bohmer, Kukull, &
Heyman, 1988; Freedman, Martin, & Schoeni, 2002; Zsembik,
Peek, & Peek, 2002). It often leads to placement in a nursing
home (Branch & Jette, 1982; Kelman & Thomas, 1990),
hospitalization, and death (Sloan & Taylor 2002). In spite of its
importance to health, functioning, and for maintaining in-
dependence, few studies have examined differences in
cognitive function among the elderly population by race or
ethnicity (see, e.g., Bohnstedt, Fox, & Kohatsu, 1994; Whitfield
et al., 2000; also see Bohannon, Fillenbaum, Pieper, Hanlon,
& Blazer, 2002; Cagney & Lauderdale, 2002). Until recently,
data have been lacking to assess longitudinal trajectories in
cognitive function by race or ethnicity. Research on differences
in cognitive performance among older adults has been impeded
by lack of information on antecedents of observed differences
among elderly individuals and a lack of measures on cognitive
function that are valid for various racial and ethnic groups.
Starting in early life, cumulative disadvantage, which is
associated with race or ethnicity, may affect functioning in late
life (Kelley-Moore & Ferraro, 2004). A person's cognitive
performance after the age of 70 years plausibly reflects the
person's endowments at birth as well as the history of events
and experiences occurring during childhood and early adult-
hood, middle age, and late life. Cognition in young adulthood
reflects a combination of genetic endowment and health at birth
(Gottfredson, 2004; Hack et al., 2002), amount and quality of
schooling received (Hanushek, 2002; Margo, 1994), parental
inputs (Repetti, Taylor, & Seeman, 2002; Shaw, Krause,
Chatters, Connell, & Ingersoll-Dayton, 2004), and peer effects
(Brody, Kim, Murry, & Brown, 2003). From early to late
adulthood, people differ in the cognitive demands of work
(Amick et al., 2002; Schooler & Mulatu, 2001) and stress
(House, 2002; Mendoza-Denton, Downey, Purdie, Davis, &
Pietrzak, 2002), both at home and at work. Material
deprivation, caused by low income and wealth, may negatively
affect cognitive performance of elderly individuals (Cagney &
Lauderdale, 2002; Hack et al.). Particularly in late middle age
and thereafter, adverse health events, such as various
neurological and psychiatric diseases and diseases of other
organ systems (Mehta, Yaffe, & Covinsky, 2002; Rosenblatt,
Mehta, Romanoski, Eaton, & Lyketsos, 2003), cause impaired
cognition. Among socioeconomic variables, the best docu-
mented association is between educational attainment and per-
formance on cognitive tests. Health and wealth are at least
weakly linked over the life course (Adams, Hurd, McFadden,
Meskill, & Ribeiro, 2003). A person who is poor at age 20 and
at age 40 is much more likely to be poor at age 70. By mea-
suring cross-sectional and longitudinal differences in cognitive
performance in late life, with and without such covariates as
income, one can at least narrow alternative explanations for
observed differences. With panel data methods, effects of time-
invariant determinants of cognitive status may be eliminated as
confounding factors.
We addressed four issues in this study. First, what are cross-
sectional differences in cognitive performance of persons over
the age of 70 years by race or ethnicity? Second, to what extent
do the differences depend on how cognitive performance is
defined? Third, what are longitudinal differences by race or
ethnicity in patterns of cognitive decline by age? Fourth, how
does controlling for other factors affect observed differences in
late life by race or ethnicity at a point in time and over time?
Are differences reduced after one controls for contemporaneous
health and wealth?
In this study we used data from four waves of the Study of
Asset and Health Dynamics Among the Oldest Old (AHEAD),
a national panel survey of U.S. households headed by indi-
viduals over the age of 70 in 1993. Although many antecedents
of health and function in late life are not documented, the data
are unique in containing consistent measures of cognition,
health, and income and wealth on a large, nationally repre-
sentative sample of elderly persons over several years. We
examined effects of race or ethnicity on cognitive performance
by using three alternative measures. Each measure has positive
attributes, but each is subject to potential bias, albeit for
different reasons.
The study's contribution is that it measures cognitive
performance by using alternative approaches, which allows an

assessment of robustness of findings, in a longitudinal panel
spanning 7 years. To mitigate confounding from other
influences including socioeconomic characteristics and health
status, and to permit comparisons with unadjusted differences
by race or ethnicity, we also included such explanatory
variables as self-reported physical and mental health, marital
status, vision and hearing limitations, and income and wealth.
METHODS
Data
AHEAD is a national panel survey of U.S. households.
When the first wave was conducted in 1993, the survey
sampled noninstitutionalized persons aged 70þ years and their
spouses or partners, who could be any age. Follow-up
interviews of the same sampled persons were conducted in
1995, 1998, and 2000, irrespective of their living arrangements.
In 1998 and 2000, AHEAD was merged with the Health and
Retirement Study (HRS), a panel survey of persons who were
primarily aged 51 to 61 when initially interviewed in 1992.
Sample Construction
We excluded respondents who were younger than 70 at
baseline from our analysis, yielding a sample of 7,443 at Wave
1. In follow-up interviews, observations were lost because of
death or other reasons for sample attrition. Over 10% of
respondents typically died between two consecutive waves, and
attrition for reasons other than death was between 6% and 7%.
Combining observations from waves yielded a sample of
23,120 observations. Some analyses excluded cases in which
proxy respondents were used, which reduced the number of
observations to 19,964.
Cognition Measures
Cognitive performance reflects a variety of abilities, in-
cluding memory, conceptual and spatial skills, and use of
language (Suthers, Kim, & Crimmins, 2003). Measures avail-
able in AHEAD permitted us to assess cognition in three ways,
using (a) a cognition test administered to persons who could
respond to cognition questions; (b) assessments by proxy
respondents of the respondent's cognitive performance for
persons who could not respond to the cognition questions for
reasons of poor physical health, low cognition, or other factors;
and (c) daily activities that rely on cognition and other skills,
based on answers by sample persons who responded to the
survey questions or answers provided by proxies.
Cognition test. --AHEAD included a battery of identical
questions in each wave to elicit the cognitive performance of
respondents. This summary measure was based on a modified
version of the Telephone Interview for Cognitive Status (TICS)
and tests of immediate and delayed verbal recall (Brandt,
Spencer, & Folstein, 1988; Herzog & Wallace, 1997). These
questions included a memory test based on word recall,
a working memory measure based on a serial 7s subtraction
test, and a test of knowledge, language, and orientation, which
involved naming objects, answering vocabulary questions, and
answering such questions as responding to today's date. In our
basic specification, we assigned missing values a value of 0.
The word recall test required respondents to remember as
many words as possible from a list of 10 words provided by the
interviewer. Respondents were then asked to recall the list of
words twice: immediately after and 5 min after the list of words
was administered (maximum, 20 points). The serial subtraction
test required the respondent to subtract 7 from 100 five times
(maximum, 5 points). Respondents were also asked to count
backward starting from 20 to 10. If the respondent did not
perform this task correctly the first time, the person was asked
to repeat the exercise. We assigned values of 2, 1, or 0,
depending on whether the respondent counted backward
correctly, either the first time, the second time, or not at all.
The knowledge, language, and orientation test asked
respondents the month, day, year, and day of week of the
interview (maximum, 4 points). The naming of objects exercise
required the respondent to name the following: the thing used to
cut paper; the prickly plant that grows in the desert; the current
U.S. President; and the current U.S. Vice President (maximum,
4 points). The maximum score was 35 points, with the word
recall, subtraction test, and knowledge, language, and orienta-
tion components having maximum scores of 20, 5, and
10, respectively.
The cognitive tasks represented a range of difficulty levels,
with naming tasks being the easiest and the recall and the serial
7s tasks being the most difficult. The survey used a combination
of in-person and telephone interviews. Herzog and Rodgers
(1999) found no difference in measured performance depending
on whether the cognitive test was conducted over the telephone
or in person.
Proxy assessments of sample persons' cognitive perfor-
mance. --Proxy respondents were used when the sample person
was unable to respond because of illness, refusal to cooperate,
or inability to understand the interviewer's language (14% of
cases). Proxy respondents were asked to respond to questions
about a sample person's cognitive status on a 5-point scale
ranging from excellent to poor. We specified binary variables,
classifying responses from excellent through fair as good (¼ 1)
and poor as bad (¼ 0). The dependent variables were (a)
exercised good judgment; (b) had good memory; (c) had good
organizational ability; and (d) did not wander off.
Herzog and Rodgers (1999), using AHEAD Wave 2
respondents, compared cognitive performance on the afore-
mentioned test among persons they could interview who
required a proxy with those who could respond on their own.
Not surprisingly, there were large differences in performance.
Respondents represented by a proxy but who took the test
anyway had a mean score of 9.5 on the cognitive test just
described, compared with 20.1 for persons without a proxy.
Ability to perform personal tasks. --The third set of depen-
dent variables was based on measures of personal activities
requiring some, but not exclusively, cognitive skill (Foley,
Heimovitz, Guralnik, & Brock, 2002; Stutts, Stewart, &
Martell, 1998). The binary variables for self- or proxy-reported
ability to perform personal tasks, several of which were lim-
itations in instrumental activities of daily living (IADLs), were
1 if the person had difficulty in (a) preparing hot meals, (b)
shopping for groceries, (c) making telephone calls, (d) taking
medication, (e) driving, (f) managing money, and (g) using
RACIAL­ETHNIC DISPARITIES IN COGNITIVE FUNCTION P243
a map (to figure out how to get around in a strange place). We
coded persons unable to do the task at all as having difficulty
and assigned them a value of 1.
Except for ability to drive and manage money, questions
about specific tasks followed affirmative responses to this
screening question: ``Because of a health or memory problem,
do you have any difficulty in . . . (list of tasks)?'' In Wave 1, the
question specified whether help was needed rather than whether
the respondent had difficulty in performing the task. Thus, the
responses were not exactly comparable over time. For this
reason, and to account for secular trends not otherwise
accounted for by the explanatory variables, in the longitudinal
analysis, we included binary variables for individual waves
with Wave 1, the omitted reference group.
For driving, the survey did not specify whether driving or not
driving was due to a health or memory problem in any wave. In
Wave 1, the question about managing money was worded as
difficulty in general. Beginning with Wave 2, the survey asked
specifically whether the difficulty was attributable to a health
or memory problem. This change in the way the question
was posed accounts for a decrease between Waves 1 and 2 in
the fraction of sample persons who had difficulty in manag-
ing money.
The tasks with the highest proportions of persons having
difficulty were using a map and driving. As with the proxy
assessments, we excluded observations with missing values for
the particular activity.
Explanatory Variables
Explanatory variables for race and ethnicity were White
(omitted reference group), Black, Hispanic, and other race.
Because Hispanics could be of any race, we assigned all
persons who self-reported as being Hispanic to the Hispanic
category; others were classified as either White, Black, or
other race. Although other race is likely to have been pre-
dominately Asian, AHEAD did not release any data on national
origin in its public use file. Other demographic variables were
age, gender (male ¼ 1), marital status (currently married ¼ 1),
and educational attainment (in years), and self-reported
measures of an emotional, nervous, or psychiatric problem,
depressive symptoms, vision and hearing impairments, and
overall health.
The variable for depressive symptoms was based on an
abridged (8-item) version of the 20-item Center for Epidemi-
ological Studies­Depression (CES-D) scale to measure de-
pression level (Radloff, 1977). The survey asked the respondent
to rate his or her vision and hearing on a 5-point scale ranging
from excellent to poor and, for vision, allowed for a sixth type
of response that the person was legally blind. We defined
a variable for ``visually impaired'' if the person responded that
his or her vision was poor or if he or she was legally blind. For
hearing, we defined the person as ``hearing impaired'' if he or
she reported poor ability to hear. We included measures of
household income, wealth, and a binary variable for negative
net worth, set to 1 if the household's liabilities exceeded its
assets. When net worth was negative, we set the continuous
variable for wealth to 0.
In the analysis of personal tasks, we included a binary
variable indicating whether the information on difficulty with
performing the task was provided by a proxy or the respondent.
The cognitive test was only administered to sample persons
who did not use a proxy. Proxy assessments of cognition were
only asked when a proxy respondent was used.
Estimation
We performed both a cross-sectional analysis, based on
Wave 1 data, and a longitudinal analysis based on data from all
four waves. In the longitudinal analysis, we used person-
specific (individual) fixed effects and a time trend to measure
the effects of aging. By accounting for omitted heterogeneity,
individual fixed effects accounted for unobserved factors
related to attrition and other time-invariant factors. Parameter
estimates on the time trend variables in the longitudinal analysis
show the relationship between age and the dependent variables
for the omitted reference group, Whites. By interacting the time
trend (minimum, 0; maximum, 7) with binary variables for
Black, Hispanic, and other races, we could assess differences
in the age trajectories between Whites and the other race or
ethnicity groups. AHEAD's Wave 1 did not obtain information
about ability to use a map; our cross-sectional analysis of using
maps was based on Wave 2 and our longitudinal analysis was
based on Waves 2­4.
Our main purpose in the longitudinal analysis was to assess
trajectories in indicators of cognitive performance as persons
grew older. The individual fixed effects controlled for age at
entry to the sample. In the longitudinal analysis, we only
included covariates that were time varying. We excluded race
or ethnicity (not interacted with the wave binary variables),
gender, and educational attainment from this analysis.
When the dependent variable was the TICS score or one of
its components, we used ordinary least squares. When the
dependent variable was a binary in cross-sectional analysis--
proxy versus self-report, cognitive assessments by respondents
requiring a proxy, and ability to perform personal tasks at
Wave 1--we used logit regression (STATA, version 7.0).
When the dependent variable was a binary variable in the
longitudinal analysis, we used a linear probability model.
Although STATA contained software for logit analysis with
fixed effects, this program was impractical for our study, given
the large number of individual fixed effects in our analysis. We
also used a linear probability model in the cross-sectional
analysis to permit a comparison of the findings with results
from the logit analysis.
RESULTS
Trends in Cognitive Test Scores
and in Limitations in IADLs
Median and mean total cognitive test scores for Whites at
Wave 1 were 21 and 20.1, respectively, out of a maximum total
score of 35. Mean scores for Blacks, Hispanics, and other race
were significantly lower than for Whites (all p , .001), with
14.3 for Blacks, 15.4 for Hispanics, and 15.8 for other race. In
addition, Whites were much less likely than the other groups to
have scored 10 or less.
Mean scores on the TICS for Whites and Blacks declined
from 1 to 2 points from Wave 1 through Wave 4, a 7-year
period. Scores for Hispanics decreased less than this, whereas
scores for persons in the other-race category increased.
SLOAN AND WANG
P244
The mean number of difficulties in performing personal tasks
increased between Waves 1 and 4 for persons in all race or
ethnicity groups. Except for Hispanics, the increase was
monotonic. At baseline, Whites had fewer difficulties on average
than did persons in the other race or ethnicity groups; by Wave 4,
the mean number of difficulties had increased by about 0.45 (out
of seven tasks). Differences in the mean number of difficulties
between Whites and Blacks increased between Waves 1 and 4.
Differences in Mean Values of Explanatory
Variables by Race or Ethnicity
Mean age did not differ among the four race or ethnicity
subsamples. However, there were particularly large differences
in mean years of schooling, household income, and wealth.
Whites, on average, had 11.5 years of schooling; this was in
contrast to 8.4 for Blacks, 5.9 for Hispanics, and 9.9 years for
other race. Mean income ranged from $27,700 for Whites to
$13,600 for Blacks and $12,500 for Hispanics. Only about 1%
of Whites had negative net worth. Percentages for the other
groups were considerably higher; up to 6% of Hispanics had
a negative net worth.
Cognitive Tests Scores: Cross-Sectional
Regression Analysis
Holding other factors constant, we found that, compared with
Whites, at baseline (Wave 1), Blacks' total scores on the TICS
were 3.5 points lower ( p , .001) on average (Table 1). The
3.5-point difference was considerably lower than the un-
adjusted White­Black difference of 5.8 points. The adjusted
differences at Wave 1 between Whites and other race were
nearly as large as were the adjusted differences between Whites
and Blacks, at 3.1 points ( p , .001); the adjusted differences
between Whites and Hispanics were smaller, 0.9 ( p ¼ .003),
than those between Whites and the two other groups and much
smaller than the unadjusted difference of 4.7. Controlling for
the other factors had a much larger effect on the difference
between the scores for Whites and Hispanics than between
Whites and the other two groups.
Having a higher age ( p , .001), being of the male gender
( p , .001), attaining lower educational levels ( p , .001),
having a sensory problem, both for vision ( p ¼ .007) and
hearing ( p , .001), having a higher number of depressive
symptoms ( p , .001), and being in poor health ( p ¼ .007)
were associated with a lower total score. There were no
statistically significant relationships between the total score and
marital status, having ever had a psychological problem, and
wealth or income. Only one coefficient on wealth or income
was statistically significant at conventional levels--for negative
net worth in the analysis of the subtraction test.
Almost half of the difference in total scores between Whites
and Blacks and between Whites and other race reflected
differences in word recall, for which there was a 1.3 difference
( p , .001), adjusted for effects of other covariates, out of
a maximum score of 20. There was no statistically significant
difference between Whites and Hispanics in word recall. About
half of the difference in the total scores between Hispanics and
whites reflected lower scores for Hispanics on knowledge,
language, and orientation. Spanish speakers could take the
Spanish-language version of AHEAD, but this does not exclude
the possibility of cultural biases in the test, especially on the
knowledge, language, and orientation component.
For other race, the largest difference with Whites was in
word recall ( p , .001). The White­other race differential in
word recall was the same as that between Whites and Blacks.
Persons of other race performed slightly better than Blacks on
the subtraction and the knowledge, language, and orientation
tests. Persons who self-reported as being of other race were
administered the English version of AHEAD.

RACIAL­ETHNIC DISPARITIES IN COGNITIVE FUNCTION P245
Cognitive Test Scores: Longitudinal
Regression Analysis
Total cognitive test scores declined over time for Whites, the
omitted reference group ( p , .001; see Table 2). With time-
varying covariates included, the decline in total scores between
Waves 1 and 4 for Whites was 0.26 per year ( p , .001), about
the same as the unadjusted rate of decline. Total scores declined
for Blacks, but at an annual rate of 0.06 less than that for
Whites ( p ¼ .041). This lower rate of decline reflected a lower
rate of decline in word recall ( p , .001), although scores
declined for both groups. For Hispanics, total scores improved
relative to Whites at a rate of 0.10 per year ( p¼.028). For other
race, not only did scores improve relative to Whites ( p , .001),
but there was an improvement in total score with age, and in
each of the three components of the total score.
Proxy Assessments: Probability That
a Proxy was Used
Blacks, Hispanics, and persons of other race were all more
likely than Whites to have had a proxy respondent (all p , .01
or better; see Table 3). Black ( p ¼ .003) and Hispanic ( p ¼
.006) respondents both had a 0.02 higher probability of using
a proxy. Persons of other race were more likely to have used
a proxy than were Blacks and Hispanics, at 0.11 higher than
Whites ( p , .001). Older persons, men, married individuals,
and persons with fewer years of schooling were more likely to
have required a proxy respondent (all ps , .001). Persons who
reported that they had ever had a nervous, emotional, or
psychological condition, those with vision and hearing impair-
ments, and those in fair or poor health were more likely to have
relied on proxies ( p , .001), as were persons within low-
income households ( p¼.002) or with negative worth ( p¼.003).
Proxy Assessments of Sample Persons' Cognitive
Performance: Cross-Sectional Regression Analysis
Our next set of measures of cognitive functioning was based
on assessments by proxy respondents--either informal care-
givers (relatives, friends) or paid caregivers of the sample
person (Table 4). The largest difference between Blacks and
Whites was in organizational ability. Blacks were 0.19 less
likely than Whites to have had good organizational ability ( p ,
.001). The next largest difference was for good judgment.
According to the proxy reports, Blacks were 0.11 less likely to
have had good judgment ( p ¼ .02). There were no statistically
significant differences between Blacks and Whites in the
probability of having good memory or for having never
wandered off. For Hispanics and other race, there were no
statistically significant differences between these groups and
Whites on any of the four measures.
Difficulty in Performing Daily Tasks: Cross-Sectional
Regression Analysis
At baseline, Blacks were less likely than Whites to be able to
perform five of seven tasks: preparing hot meals, 0.02 less
likely ( p ¼ .02); making telephone calls, 0.02 less likely ( p ,
.001); taking medication, 0.01 less likely ( p , .001); driving,
0.16 less likely ( p , .001); and using a map, 0.12 less likely
( p , .001; see Table 5, marginal effects from the logit
analysis). Hispanics were less able to perform five of these tasks
than were Whites: preparing hot meals, 0.02 less likely ( p ¼
.03); shopping for groceries, 0.04 less likely ( p ¼ .01); making
telephone calls, 0.02 less likely ( p ¼ .004); driving, 0.23 less
likely ( p , .001); and using a map, 0.11 less likely ( p ¼ .006).
For other race, the only statistically significant differences
compared with Whites were in preparing hot meals, 0.05

less likely ( p¼.02) and in ability to drive, 0.26 less likely ( p ,
.001).
As an alternative to logit analysis, we also estimated linear
probability models (not shown). In one instance, we found
a statistically significant difference at conventional levels for
a race­ethnicity variable with logit but not with linear
probability. In the latter analysis, the p value for preparing
hot meals for Hispanics fell from .03 with logit to .08 with
linear probability. The parameter estimates from the linear
probability analysis imply marginal effects that are only slightly
different from their logit counterparts.
Many other factors were associated with ability to perform
the tasks. For example, higher wealth was associated with
a higher probability of being able to drive ( p , .001). Those
with negative net worth were less likely to be able to prepare
hot meals, shop for groceries, drive, or manage money. More
educated persons were more likely to be able to make
a telephone call ( p , .001); drive ( p , .001); manage money
( p , .001); and use a map ( p , .001).
Difficulty in Performing Daily Tasks: Longitudinal
Regression Analysis
Judging from the coefficients on the trend variables, we found
that ability to perform each of the seven daily tasks declined
with age for Whites (Table 6); the decreases in the probability of
having difficulty in performing tasks ranged from .003 per year
for managing money to .021 for driving. For Blacks, ability to
prepare hot meals ( p , .001), shop for groceries ( p ¼.03), and
manage money ( p , .001) declined with age relative to Whites.
Relative declines were greatest for preparing hot meals and
managing money. Blacks' ability to drive improved relative to
Whites ( p , .001) but declined in absolute terms. By contrast,
for Hispanics, the ability to shop for groceries ( p ¼ .02)
improved relative to Whites with age. Driving improved relative
to Whites ( p ¼ .049), but, as for Blacks, declined in absolute
terms. For other race, differences in rates of decline were
statistically significant from Whites at conventional levels. This
analysis controlled for time-varying covariates, marital status,
health, income, wealth, and use of a proxy respondent.
Coefficients on the proxy variable, all statistically significant
( p , .001), are substantial in magnitude.
DISCUSSION
Holding other factors likely to affect cognitive functioning
constant, and using three alternative types of dependent
variables, each measure subject to different kinds of potential
measurement error or even bias, we found appreciable cross-
sectional differences at baseline in cognitive test scores on the
basis of race or ethnicity, with the largest differences being
between Blacks and Whites. Including covariates reduced the
differentials between Blacks and Whites and Hispanics and
Whites. Longitudinal analysis spanning 7 years revealed a
decline in test scores for two of the three measures for Whites,
the omitted reference group. Performance on the cognitive test
declined with age for Blacks and Hispanics as for Whites, but at
a somewhat lower rate. Scores for the other race category
actually improved with age. However, for several personal
tasks, performance of Blacks declined even more than that of
Whites. Persons of other race had higher scores on the cognitive
test in the later waves, but their ability to perform the tasks
declined at about the same rate as that for Whites. Hispanics'
performance on the cognitive test declined less than did that of

RACIAL­ETHNIC DISPARITIES IN COGNITIVE FUNCTION P247
Whites, but, with one exception, Hispanics did not improve
relative to Whites in performing personal tasks.
The compression in performance between Whites and other
race and Whites and Hispanics plausibly reflected some recent
immigrants' increased familiarity with life in the United States.
Another possibility is that they had less familiarity with
responding to household surveys initially, and they learned
how to respond to cognition questions over time. Such learning is
evident in a temporary improvement in scores at Wave 2, which
eventually was offset by the effects of aging on test performance.
Both the baseline differences in all three measures and the lack
of convergence between elderly Blacks and Whites are
troublesome. For one, they may reflect a continuing legacy of
segregation and discrimination. For another, they many reflect
a differential need for support (such as for formal care) that is not
being currently met by the public sector. Differences persisted in
our analysis even after we accounted for variation in educational
attainment, marital status, health, income, and wealth, and, for
the personal tasks, a binary variable for proxy status, all of which
differed systematically between Blacks and Whites.
In the longitudinal analysis, we accounted for time-varying
changes in health and wealth and income and in marital status.
Trajectories of these variables by race or ethnicity differ over
the life course. By including measures of levels in late life, we

accounted for this. Low earnings in early and midlife are likely
to be reflected in low wealth in late life, as are differences by
race or ethnicity in lifelong attachment to the labor force
(Antecol & Bedard, 2004). Although a person's health is likely
to fluctuate over time, on average, poor health earlier in the life
course is likely to be associated with poorer health in late life.
The longitudinal analysis with fixed effects eliminated
influences of time-invariant factors, both those measured, such
as educational attainment and gender, and those not measured
by AHEAD, such as genetic endowment, cumulative effects of
stress, and relative lack of intellectual or stimulating job
opportunities, with one important caveat. If there are interac-
tions between race or ethnicity and these omitted factors, then
a panel data analysis with fixed effects does not eliminate the
influence of these factors.
We assumed that respondents who did not answer a particular
question on the cognition test did not really know the answer.
Making the opposite assumption, that the person knew the
answer, produced few differences in findings.
Any one measure of cognition may be subject to specific
biases. In our study, we allowed for differences in measurement
tools and in evaluators of the sample persons' cognitive status.
With one of the three measures, the evaluators were often
relatives or friends of the sample person. Another measure relied
completely on self-responses, but there may be differences in
test validity related to race or ethnicity. The third mainly relied
on self-responses, with a minority of responses coming from
proxies (14%); this measure related to specific activities in
which persons of all races and ethnicities commonly engage,
rather than on responses to a test. Relative to the other two
measures, measures of difficulty in performing daily activities
are less direct measures of cognitive performance. To account
for other influences on the dependent variables, we included
covariates, such as for physical health, education, and, in
specifications not shown, family income. If there are biases, it
seems very unlikely that the biases are all in the same direction.
Even though our analysis was more comprehensive in using
a panel and in the range of dependent variables included, our
findings are consistent with previous research showing differ-
ences by race or ethnicity in cognitive performance, even with
controls for such variables as educational attainment (Branch
& Jette, 1982; Shapiro & Tate, 1991; Herzog & Wallace, 1997;
Leveille et al., 1998; Whitfield et al., 2000). A recent lon-
gitudinal analysis with limitations in ADLs as the measure of
disability found a gap between Black and White elderly people,
but, controlling for various socioeconomic and health variables,
the researchers found that the trajectories of disability by race
were not statistically different (Kelley-Moore & Ferraro, 2004).
The researchers concluded that the evidence supported ``per-
sistent inequality.'' In our analysis, with different measures of
activity limitations, there was some widening of the differential
on several measures. The differences in mean cognitive scores
reflected higher relative frequencies of very low scores and
scores in the lower middle range for Blacks, other non-Whites,
and Hispanics than for Whites. Differences in relative fre-
quency at the upper range of scores did not differ according to
race or ethnicity.
On appropriateness of the cognitive measures, other well-
controlled studies using other measures of cognitive function,
such as the Blessed Dementia Scale (Proctor et al., 1997) and
the Short Portable Mental Status Questionnaire, including
apolipoprotein E genotype (Fillenbaum, Heyman, Prosnitz, &
Burchett, 1999; Fillenbaum et al., 2001), also obtained sig-
nificant differences in cognitive performance by race.
Cross-sectional differences in cognitive performance be-
tween Blacks and Whites have been attributed to poorer
physical health for Blacks, as measured by higher prevalence of
diseases known to affect cognition, such as hypertension,
diabetes mellitus, high cholesterol, myocardial infarction, and
lower levels of physical activity and fitness (Dustman,
Emmerson, & Shearer, 1994; Izquierdo-Porrera & Waldstein,
2002). However, when we included self-reports of mental and
physical health, we still found Black­White differences.
Including physical health measures reduced the measured
disparities but did not eliminate them; this result is consistent
with evidence from studies on more limited populations, such
as patients discharged from a hospital (Proctor et al., 1997).
Several study limitations should be acknowledged. First,
although we have documented patterns of racial and ethnic
disparities, we could not sort out reasons for the cross-sectional
and longitudinal patterns we documented. The term racial
disparities is widely used, but what role race plays in empirical
analysis critically depends on what else is held constant. Our
analysis controlled for many other factors associated with race
or ethnicity.
Second, this study was based on a single cohort. Particular
cohorts have unique characteristics that reflect their life cycle
experiences in part. For example, many Blacks in our study
grew up under Jim Crow. All persons experienced the Great
Depression or its aftermath and World War II as children. Many
Hispanics and persons of other races were recent immigrants to
the United States. Some empirical evidence suggests that
disparities in cognitive performance among elderly people
between Blacks and non-Blacks may be declining over time
(Freedman et al., 2002), a pattern not reflected in our analysis of
a single cohort but perhaps present over several cohorts.
Third, we have assumed that effects of various covariates on
cognitive status are unidirectional. In fact, cognitive perfor-
mance may have important effects on income, wealth, and
health (Adams et al., 2003). Although our fixed effects analysis
somewhat mitigates the effects of reverse causality, it does not
eliminate this source of bias entirely. For any individual,
a decrease in cognitive performance could lead to a reduction in
income for the person's household or possibly the reverse if
income transfers are included. Understanding the dynamics
among health, wealth, income, and cognition is an important
task for future research.
