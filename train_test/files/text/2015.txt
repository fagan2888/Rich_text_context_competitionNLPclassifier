Abstract
Background: Levels of physical activity (PA) in the general population are difficult to characterize. Historically
measurement has been based on self-report, which can be subject to bias. PA monitor use has created
opportunities to improve surveillance and analytic research on activity and health. The aims of the current study
were to investigate the associations between objectively measured PA and cardiovascular disease risk factors and
obesity.
Methods: Data on PA from accelerometers, demographics, blood pressure, plasma glucose and lipids, self-reported
hypertension and diabetes were obtained for adults, ages 20-65, in the NHANES surveys, 2003-2006. Outcomes
were assessed as levels of moderate and vigorous activity, percentage of participants meeting recommended
guidelines, and the correlations between activity and cardiovascular risk factors. Accelerometry data were available
on 3,370 adults. Based on standard algorithms, activity levels were extremely low in all age-gender-race/ethnic
groups, with an average of only 1 bout of vigorous activity lasting longer than 1 minute/day.
Results: Men spent 35 minutes in moderate activity/day, women 21 minutes; >75% of this activity was
accumulated in 1-minute bouts. Levels of activity declined sharply after age 50 in all groups. Negative associations
were observed between minutes of combined moderate and vigorous activity and systolic blood pressure,
blood glucose, diabetes, hypertension, body mass index and obesity, and a positive association was seen with
HDL-cholesterol (all P  0.03), suggesting valid rank ordering of participants by activity level.
Conclusion: The magnitude of the gap between self-report and accelerometry activity must be a result of either a
vast social acceptability bias in reporting or inaccurate measurement with accelerometry. Therefore, due to the low
validity of self reported PA data for epidemiologic research, it is pertinent to encourage the use of valid, objective
methods to assess PA.
Background
The population burden attributable to cardiovascular
disease (CVD) has evolved rapidly over the last 50 years.
Vigorous efforts to improve levels of smoking, hyperch-
olesterolemia and uncontrolled hypertension have con-
tributed significantly to the 75% reduction in CVD
mortality in the US since 1968 [1,2]. This improvement
in lifestyle continues and several goals for Healthy Peo-
ple 2010 for heart disease and stroke risk factors have
already been met [3]. As is well recognized, however,
significant adverse trends in obesity and diabetes have
emerged and threaten to erode these gains [4]. The new
urgency attached to the prevention of obesity and its
sequelae has furthermore heightened interest in poten-
tial strategies that can limit age-related weight gain [5].
Unfortunately, despite the relatively straightforward nat-
ure of the energy equation, balancing calorie intake with
expenditure has become difficult for large segments of
the population in the current obesigenic environment.
In an attempt to address the obesity epidemic, consider-
able emphasis has therefore been placed on surveillance
of physical activity and the initiation of campaigns to
enhance leisure activity [6,7]. These strategies depend
on accurate information about patterns and levels of
energy expenditure in the general population.
In contrast to the "classic" CVD risk factors, until
recently assessment of physical activity in large popula-
tion studies has relied on self-reported questionnaires

while direct measurement has been feasible only in
relatively small validation studies [8,9]. Self-report of beha-
viors such as alcohol intake, diet and physical activity are
notoriously unreliable, being subject to both random and
systematic reporting bias [10-12]. Development of
improved physical activity monitors, i.e., accelerometers,
has now made it possible to measure activity patterns
objectively in free-living individuals [13-15]. Doubly
labeled water (DLW), a non-invasive method of indirect
calorimetry [16], has also been applied on a limited scale
to field research [17,18], however, it remains prohibitively
expensive for most large studies, and accelerometers are
likely to be the most widespread technique that will be
used for the foreseeable future.
In the 2003-2006 NHANES surveys participants wore
an accelerometer for 7 consecutive days. In this analysis
we examine the patterns of physical activity in the 3,370
individuals between 20 and 65 years with adequate qual-
ity data and non-debilitating illnesses and assess the
relationship between activity and CVD risk factors and
obesity.
Methods
Data from NHANES 2003-2006 were used in these ana-
lyses. Using a complex, multistage probability sampling
design, NHANES recruited a representative sample of
the total civilian non-institutionalized population, 2
months and older, in the United States. Briefly,
NHANES participants perform an at-home interview
and, approximately two weeks later, a clinic examination
at a mobile examination center (MEC). The examination
lasts approximately 3-4 hours and site-specific error is
minimized by standardizing all data-collection methods
[19]. All participants provide informed consent for both
the at-home interview and MEC examination and the
US Department of Health and Human Service approved
the study. During NHANES 2003-2006, a total of 20,470
individuals were interviewed and examined (all ages). Of
7,501 individuals between the ages of 20 and 65, 4,463
individuals wore the activity monitor for a minimum of
4 valid wear days. There were 1,093 adults excluded for
one of the following reasons: missing BMI data (n = 31),
pregnant at time of examination (n = 240), self-reported
race/ethnicity other than non-Hispanic white, non-His-
panic black or Mexican American (n = 343), or self-
reported chronic health condition that might have
impacted physical activity levels, such as congestive
heart failure, stroke or emphysema (n = 542). Thus, the
analytical sample included 3,370 adults between 20 and
65 years of age.
Weight (kg) and height (m) were measured according
to standard procedures and used to calculate body mass
index (BMI, kg/m2). Brachial SBP and DBP measure-
ments were made during a single examination and
following standard procedures; the average value for up
to three measurements was used [20].
Blood was drawn following an overnight fast and pro-
cessed according to standard procedures [21]; plasma
glucose and lipids concentrations were measured.
Plasma glucose was assessed and triglycerides and HDL-
cholesterol were measured in serum (Roche Diagnostics,
Indianapolis, IN), while levels of LDL-cholesterol were
calculated using the Friedewald formula [21].
Physical activity monitors (Actigraph model 7164;
Actigraph LLC; Fort Walton Beach, FL) were placed on
all ambulatory participants six years and older [22]. The
Actigraph records vertical accelerations as "counts"
representing the relative intensity of each movement
[23]. The monitor was worn over the right hip; partici-
pants were asked to wear the monitor while awake and
remove it for swimming or bathing [15]. Data were
summarized in 1-minute epochs for 7 days.
For the purpose of our analyses, we included acceler-
ometer data from 3,370 healthy individuals, 20-65 years
of age, who met our minimum wear time criteria, as
described below. Each participant was required to
achieve a minimum of 10 hrs of monitor wear on four
or more days. Wear time was determined by subtracting
non-wear time from 24 hr, while non-wear time was
defined as an interval of 60 consecutive minutes with
zero activity counts allowing for intervals of 1-2 minutes
of relatively low activity counts, i.e., 1-100 counts [15].
The average number of valid wear days was 5.97 for
men and 5.94 for women.
We defined moderate and vigorous physical activity
cut-points for adults using previously published recom-
mendations [24], as described by Troiano [15]. Briefly,
cut-points allow the conversion of accelerometer counts
into estimates of activity intensity, i.e., moderate or vig-
orous, using weighted averages. The cut-point was 2020
counts/min for moderate activity and 5999 counts/min
for vigorous; these were used to estimate the total num-
ber of minutes per day spent in each activity level. We
present physical activity data as the total time in min-
utes accumulated in either 1- or 10-minute intervals of
moderate, vigorous or moderate plus vigorous activity,
as well as activity counts per minute (ct/min). Following
prior conventions, we allowed for up to 2 minutes of
below threshold count activity before considering the
bout to be ended [15]. For these analyses, therefore, the
continuous measure of "counts over time" was con-
verted into "bouts" and these became the unit of
analysis.
As a form of sensitivity analysis, we repeated the esti-
mates of time spent in moderate or vigorous activity
using cut-points which progressively reduced the counts
per minute down to a minimum of 30% of the pre-set
standards described above [15].

Participants were identified as diabetic if they self-
reported having the condition or were taking insulin or
oral hypoglycemic medications. Participants were identi-
fied as hypertensive if they were taking anti-hypertensive
medication or their systolic blood pressure (SBP) was
140 or diastolic blood pressure (DBP) was 90. We
used standardized BMI cut-points to categorize partici-
pants as either overweight (BMI 25 and <30 kg/m2) or
obese (BMI 30 kg/m2)[22].
Statistical Methods
Data are presented as the total time accumulated in
either 1- or 10-minute bouts of activity level, mean
counts per minute and mean wear time. Weighted
means and standard errors are computed for each of the
continuous variables of interest, and proportions with
standard errors are reported for the categorical variables
by sex and race/ethnicity, accounting for the complex
sampling scheme used by NHANES. Plasma glucose
concentrations were adjusted using the fasting sampling
weights included in the NHANES dataset. Partial corre-
lation coefficients were computed for each of the physi-
cal activity measures with well-established CVD risk
factors, BMI, overweight and obesity accounting for age,
gender and race/ethnicity. Standardized coefficients
were used to express change in the dependent variable
per standard deviation in the independent variables.
Summary statistics and correlation coefficients were cal-
culated using SUDAAN (v.9, Research Triangle Park,
NC), and Stata SE (v.11, College Station, TX).
Results
The characteristics of the 3,370 participants' ages 20-65
years are presented in Table 1. The mean age of Mexi-
can-American participants was somewhat lower than for
the other racial/ethnic groups (i.e., 36 years vs. 42 for
whites and 39 for blacks). As anticipated, overweight
and obesity were common in all groups, with a substan-
tially higher prevalence in blacks. In addition, blacks had
higher blood pressures and lower total cholesterol and
LDL-C levels. Diabetes prevalence, unadjusted for age,
was higher in blacks (8.0%) than either whites (3.6%) or
Mexican Americans (5.0%), as was hypertension preva-
lence (42.9% vs. 22.4% and 12.5%, respectively).
Physical activity was summarized as the mean number
of counts per minute (cts/min) and in the categories of
moderate or vigorous, presented in 1-minute and 10-
minute bouts (Table 2). The average counts were higher
among men than women (393 vs. 321 ct/min), and high-
est among Mexican-American men and women. As
anticipated, activity declined sharply after age 50 (Figure
1). Vigorous activity was recorded very infrequently; no
gender-race groups had 1 bout of vigorous activity per
day that lasted at least 10 minutes (Table 2). Even
vigorous activity bouts of 1 minute were rare, ranging
from 0.4/day among Mexican American women to 1.5/
day among white men. Daily moderate activity was
recorded in 32 to 41 bouts of 1-minute duration in
men, and 18 to 20 1-minute bouts in women. Given the
potential for artifact, the significance of 1-minute bouts
of activity is difficult to interpret. The most stable esti-
mate of activity patterns may therefore be the number
of minutes per day spent in 10-minute bouts of activity.
This measure ranged from a high of 10.3 minutes per
day of moderate plus vigorous activity among Mexican-
American men to a low of 5.0 minutes among Mexican-
American women, with a population average of 6.6 min-
utes per day. Furthermore, over 66% of men and 68% of
women did not accumulate a single 10-minute bout of
moderate or vigorous activity on any of the days.
Previous national prevalence estimates of activity pat-
terns have come exclusively from questionnaires on dis-
crete behaviors and have suggested that relatively large
proportions of the population meet current physical
activity guidelines [8,25,26]. In contradiction, activity as
measured by activity monitors demonstrated that guide-
lines are rarely being met. Thus, only 0.2% of women
and 0.4% of men in the NHANES sample would have
met current guidelines requiring a minimum of approxi-
mately two 10-minute blocks of moderate activity per
day [6]. While more individuals accumulated greater
amounts of total moderate activity, the overwhelming
majority of this time was accounted for by 1-minute
bouts (i.e., 75%); the time spent in longer bouts declined
rapidly (Figure 2). Across the entire 6-day average per-
iod of recording, only 14% had a single block lasting 20
minutes.
Quantification of physical activity using accelerometry
depends critically on the number of counts per minute
used as the cut-point defining moderate or vigorous
activity. Accelerometers can be well calibrated for walk-
ing or running but may miss other forms of body
motion thereby underestimating intensity. As a sensitiv-
ity analysis we therefore reduced the number of counts
required to qualify as moderate/vigorous activity in a
stepwise fashion from 80% of the laboratory-validated
standard down to 30%, and repeated the analyses above.
Current guidelines of two 10-minute blocks of moderate
activity per day were met by 1.9% of the population
with the threshold reduced to 80% of the standard and
29.5% when the threshold was only 30% of the standard.
Most importantly, the majority of time in activity (~
90%) was still spent in 1 minute bouts, suggesting sus-
tained fitness-inducing exercise continued to be rare
even at this much reduced threshold of counts per
minute.
As a means of evaluating the internal validity of the
monitoring procedure we examined the relationship

between activity measures and primary cardiovascular
risk factors. In a combined analysis, with adjustment for
age, gender and race/ethnicity, both activity counts per
minute and number of minutes in 1-minute bouts were
significantly negatively associated with SBP, blood sugar,
hypertension and diabetes, while activity measures were
positively associated with HDL-cholesterol (Tables 3
&4). Table 4 presents the change in risk factor based on
a standard deviation change in the activity measure; as a
proportion of the mean for the given risk factor, the lar-
gest effect was seen for HDL-C, followed by glucose. In
Table 4, the association with hypertension and diabetes
is further summarized as the change in odds ratio; for
hypertension the odds were 20% lower, and for diabetes
35% lower, with one standard deviation increase in
activity. After removing the effect of BMI and age, a
negative association remained for plasma glucose in the
total sample and the majority of sub-groups (Table 5).
Negative associations were also seen for diabetes, hyper-
tension and HDL-cholesterol, although less consistently.
Blood pressure was unrelated to activity counts or time
spent in moderate activity in any of the separate gender-
race/ethnicity groups; this finding may be due in part to
the fact that treated hypertensives were not excluded. In

analyses that did not include BMI these associations
were roughly 30-50% larger (data not shown), indicating
the substantial confounding of the activity-risk factor
association from BMI.
Activity measures generated by the monitor were also
examined for association with relative weight (Table 6);
for brevity only moderate activity was included given
the virtual absence of vigorous activity. Statistically sig-
nificant negative associations with BMI were seen in
each gender-race/ethnicity group, with the exception of
activity counts per minute for black women, and both
measures for Mexican-American women. The associa-
tion with overweight was not consistent, and the nom-
inal relationship was positive and significant in the total
sample, albeit weak in magnitude. On the other hand,
obesity was negatively associated in all sub-groups for at
least one exposure measure, again with the exception of
Mexican-American women. The contrasting results in
overweight and obesity could in part reflect the fact that
mean BMIs were in the overweight range. Likewise, the
amount of moderate and vigorous activity in Mexican-
American women was the lowest of the sub-groups and
the sample size was modest.
Discussion
These findings from a large representative sample add a
new dimension to our understanding of the patterns and
consequences of physical activity in the US population.
The estimates of both vigorous and moderate activity were
extremely low, and contrast dramatically with those
obtained by self-report [8,25-27]. Vigorous activity lasting
even 1 minute was only observed in 2% of any of the
gender-race/ethnic groups and a 10-minute episode of
moderate activity - the intensity obtained by walking up
stairs - was recorded in only one third of the participants
on any day of monitoring. The overall pattern observed
among population sub-groups was, however, consistent
with expectations. Mexican-American men were some-
what more active than blacks or whites, which might be
attributable to physically demanding occupations, while
among women whites appeared to be slightly more active
than either blacks or Mexican Americans, possibly reflect-
ing leisure time activity. Activity declined sharply with age;
after 60 only ~ 15 minutes of moderate activity was
recorded among men and 10 minutes among women per
day. Despite the low mean levels a highly significant asso-
ciation was observed between activity level and all the
major metabolic risk factors for CVD confirming that the
measurements were valid and the effects sufficiently large
to confer physiologic consequences.
The major finding from these analyses is the demon-
stration that population estimates of activity levels from
surveys by questionnaire are markedly at variance with
those obtained by objective measurements. As the only
source available from past surveys, questionnaires have
been used in analytic research and have informed public

policy for the last 50 years. If the data presented here
are correct, a re-evaluation of the conclusions from
much of this literature would be required. For example,
based on national survey data it was assumed in Healthy
People 2010 that 23 percent of adults engaged in vigor-
ous activity of more than 20 minutes per episode at
least 3 times per week at the beginning of this decade
[3]. However, in the NHANES data presented here, < 1
percent of the population achieved this level of expendi-
ture. Likewise, current guidelines recommend 150
minutes of moderate or 75 minutes of vigorous activity
per week for adults [6]. Only 0.3%, or 10 of the 3,370
individuals in this sample, achieved that level. This
result is in stark contradiction to a recent report using
self-reported "usual occupational/domestic activity" in a
subset of the same 2003-2006 NHANES participants
where 42% of persons with a mean age of 45 met cur-
rent guidelines [28]; precision of this self-reported activ-
ity measure was apparently low, however, since it was
unassociated with CVD risk factors. The findings of this

days = 5.95)

recent report are not atypical as current trends based on
questionnaires suggest that a large proportion of the
population engages in recreational activity; these trends,
however, could well be biased by a social desirability
effect [6,29,30].
Is the large scale downward shift of the magnitude
described here a plausible assessment of activity patterns
in the US population? On the surface the discrepancy
between questionnaire and measured activity exceeds
reasonable expectation. The only measure of validity
available from the NHANES survey itself was replication
of the risk factor associations. An extensive literature
from observational studies and trials supports the asso-
ciation between exercise and CVD risk factors [31-33],

therefore replication of these relationships makes it is
reasonable to assert that the accelerometer data from
NHANES are capturing the physiologic benefit asso-
ciated with increasing levels of physical activity. Admit-
tedly this validation is indirect, and additional evidence
must be sought in external studies which used similar
methods. Objective measurement of energy expenditure
has only become feasible in the last two decades, and
few of the available studies include representative popu-
lation samples [17,18], therefore we know of no other
studies bearing directly on this question. Methodological
studies suggest that activity estimates from question-
naires are only correlated at approximately 0.2 with
DLW, generally viewed as the most accurate approach
[34]. Activity monitors, on the other hand, have been
shown to correlate on average at 0.5-0.6 with energy
expenditure in activity [14,35,36], representing a sub-
stantial increase in precision.
The critical question for these NHANES data, how-
ever, is not the degree to which accelerometry places
individuals in the correct rank order of increasing activ-
ity, but whether the absolute amount of activity is being
measured more accurately than by questionnaire. A
recent review examined mean differences between esti-
mates from DLW vs. questionnaire in 20 studies [34].
These studies were extremely heterogeneous in terms of
sample size, type of participants and the questionnaire
and, not surprisingly, the results were highly inconsis-
tent; questionnaires overestimated energy expenditure
by 1,000 kcal/day in some instances and under-esti-
mated by 400 kcal/day in others [34]. A similarly hetero-
geneous literature exists on the concordance between
accelerometry and DLW [14]. Contrary to question-
naires, accelerometry slightly under-estimated total
expenditure in all but one report, and mean differences
tended to be much smaller - in the range of 100 - 200
kcal/day, or about 15 - 25% of physical activity expendi-
ture. A second comprehensive review summarized the
concordance between accelerometry and questionnaires
in 47 validation studies [37]. On average, questionnaires
recorded 44% more daily energy expenditure than did
activity monitors. This second review also found that
the degree of heterogeneity in the comparison of ques-
tionnaires with DLW was so great that no conclusions
were possible, although there was an indication that the
discrepancy was larger for women than men [37]. It
must be recognized that the individual studies reviewed
used a variety of instruments, each applying a different
algorithm to generate caloric expenditure from activity
counts, and they may not be directly comparable to the
instrument used in NHANES. In general, however, it
seems reasonable to conclude that questionnaires are
subject to widely varying bias, most often leading to
large over-estimates, while accelerometry has a far smal-
ler, contrary tendency to under-estimation. This evi-
dence would suggest that true expenditure among
NHANES participants is closer to the accelerometry
estimates, although somewhat higher. Nonetheless, even
when applying a threshold of counts per minute that
was only 30% of the standard set by direct calorimetry
relatively few individuals met the guidelines.
Accelerometry is of course subject to potential biases.
For example, cycling or activities that require weight
bearing will not be adequately captured, although these
are infrequent in the general population. Likewise the
device is not worn while swimming. Artifactual increases
in counts can also occur as a result of external sources

of motion, such as riding in a vehicle. Artifact is a parti-
cularly important bias for these data since the vast
majority of activity was recorded in episodes lasting only
1 minute. These short bursts are unlikely to represent
intentional efforts to accumulate fitness-inducing exer-
cise or physically demanding tasks at work of the type
that would be captured by questionnaires. In fact, per-
haps the most robust conclusion from this survey is that
very few Americans engage in sustained activity, such as
jogging or long walks, on a frequent basis. Likewise, in
an on-going multi-national survey we have also observed
a very low frequency of 10-minute bouts of activity in
all 5 study populations (A. Luke, unpublished data).
Clearly a more detailed analysis of questionnaire data in
concert with accelerometry, and preferably DLW, will
be required to resolve these questions.
In addition to the associations with metabolic risk fac-
tors, significant but quantitatively weak negative associa-
tions exist between the activity measures and BMI and
obesity. Likewise, after accounting for BMI, the associa-
tion with CVD risk factors was substantially weakened,
highlighting the confounding that would be expected
among these variables. The activity-BMI relationship
cannot be considered causal, however, since these data
are cross-sectional. Causality could be operating in the
opposite direction or in both directions simultaneously.
In fact, whether increased activity prevents weight gain
is a contentious question. Despite the widely held per-
ception that low levels of energy expenditure in activity
is an important risk factor for obesity, prospective data
do not support this view [18,38]. Randomized trials,
where activity levels are rigorously measured and no
attempt is made to restrict calories, likewise show that
even substantial increases in energy expenditure in exer-
cise do not result in weight loss because of compensa-
tory increases in intake [39,40]. We conclude, therefore,
that the associations observed in the NHANES data pre-
sented here between activity and relative weight are
spurious - i.e., the direction of the causality is most
likely from obesity to lower activity.
Previous analyses of the NHANES activity monitoring
data have noted a similar outcome as reported here with
regard to levels of activity for the US population and the
association with obesity [13,15,41-44]. Troiano et al. [15]
and Metzger et al. [13] reported a slightly higher propor-
tion of the US population meeting the current physical
activity guidelines than our estimate (i.e., 5%). Metzger et
al. used the data to define 5 classes of physical activity,
including two classes of very low activity. The combined
physical activity level of these 2 classes was less than 25
min of moderate/vigorous physical activity per day and
represented almost 79% of the US population [13].
One of the challenges for activity assessment by accel-
erometry has been the choice of appropriate summary
measures. Multiple alternative measures have been used
and the results are often difficult to interpret or com-
pare across studies [45-47]. After detailed preliminary
analyses we chose three basic metrics - activity counts
per minute and time spent in either vigorous or moder-
ate activity. As noted, the 1-minute bouts are subject to
over-estimation of activity across the day due to instabil-
ity of the monitor The 10-minute bouts are potentially
meaningful with regard to health benefits, but may not
be capturing the true activity patterns of Americans and
2- or 3-minute bouts could yield different results. How-
ever, as shown in Figure 2, much less data will be avail-
able with these cut-points. Using data from an on-going
multi-country study, we estimated an intraclass correla-
tion coefficient of 0.88 with six days of activity monitor-
ing, indicating the NHANES data presented here with
an average of 6 days, characterize the individual's activ-
ity patterns over the measurement period quite well (A.
Luke, unpublished data).
Conclusion
These analyses of the NHANES physical activity moni-
tor data demonstrate that the US population is seden-
tary to a degree well beyond what had previously been
assumed. Questionnaires on activity, as in most
attempts to assess health behaviors, are subject to a
strong social desirability bias. Numerous examples
exist in the public health literature on behaviors as dis-
parate as smoking and sexual practices [48,49] and it is
somewhat surprising in fact that reported data on
activity have been taken at face value for so long.
Nonetheless the degree of discrepancy exceeds reason-
able expectations and unrecognized methodological
problems may exist with use of accelerometry in the
general population. This detailed analysis of the
NHANES results provides a starting point from which
to address this important question. Research and sur-
veillance in this vital area will continue to be of limited
value until we have access to accurate objective meth-
ods of measurement.
