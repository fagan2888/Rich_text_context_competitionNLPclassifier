The Growing Power Of Some
Providers To Win Steep Payment
Increases From Insurers Suggests
Policy Remedies May Be Needed
ABSTRACT In the constant attention paid to what drives health care costs,
only recently has scrutiny been applied to the power that some health
care providers, particularly dominant hospital systems, wield to negotiate
higher payment rates from insurers. Interviews in twelve US communities
indicated that so-called must-have hospital systems and large physician
groups--providers that health plans must include in their networks so
that they are attractive to employers and consumers--can exert
considerable market power to obtain steep payment rates from insurers.
Other factors, such as offering an important, unique service or access in a
particular geographic area, can contribute to provider leverage as well.
Even in markets with dominant health plans, insurers generally have not
been aggressive in constraining rate increases, perhaps because the
insurers can simply pass along the costs to employers and their workers.
Although government intervention--through rate setting or antitrust
enforcement--has its place, our findings suggest a range of market and
regulatory approaches should be examined in any attempt to address the
consequences of growing provider market clout.
Much attention in health policy
has focused on large in-
creases in insurers' premi-
ums. However, another issue
is also receiving scrutiny:
providers' negotiating clout to demand higher
prices from commercial health plans.1,2 Recent
analyses suggest that hospital and physician pay-
ment rate increases that outpace the rate of cost
increases are major contributors to rising pre-
miums for employer-sponsored insurance.3
Providers' growing negotiating strength also en-
ables them to modify contract terms, blocking
health plans' attempts to steer patients to low-
cost providers.
Although provider market power is gaining
attention, important variations in the story are
going unnoticed. In some markets, leverage has
not shifted decisively toward providers. Further-
more, within markets, different hospitals and
physician practices have different amounts
of clout.
Some health care systems, commonly referred
to as "must-have" providers--meaning providers
that health plans must include in their networks
to attract employers and consumers--have used
their clout to raise prices. Others are "price tak-
ers" and have no choice but to accept lower rates.
Our findings describe multiple tiers of providers
based on differential negotiating leverage. In
general, hospitals enjoy greater negotiating lev-
erage than physician practices, although physi-
cians are now becoming part of hos-
pitals--primarily through employment or other
means--for purposes of contract negotiations or
are consolidating to emulate the ways in which
hospitals gain leverage.4
However, the consolidation taking place in
many markets often falls outside transactions
that are subject to traditional antitrust enforce-

ment. There are also other important factors,
unrelated to provider consolidation, that affect
the balance of negotiating power between pro-
viders and health plans. Most tip the scale in the
favor of hospitals.
In this article, we present findings from the
Community Tracking Study (described below)
related to provider market power. First, we dis-
cuss the variations observed across and within
markets. Next, we present various reasons why
leverage has shifted to some hospitals and physi-
cian organizations. We then explore the various
common forms of consolidation, including
those that do not raise conventional antitrust
concerns.
Our research found that although dominant
health plans might be able to restrain prices
and achieve other contracting advantages, they
also must be sensitive to their employer custom-
ers' preferences for stable provider networks.
Therefore, they are willing to tolerate large price
increases from providers--as long as these insur-
ers' competitors, other health plans, pay higher
rates. We conclude the article by discussing
whether the Affordable Care Act of 2010 is likely
to alter current negotiations, and we outline pol-
icy options to address the cost-increasing
consequences of provider market power.
Study Data And Methods
The Community Tracking Study, conducted by
the Center for Studying Health System Change
and funded by the Robert Wood Johnson Foun-
dation and the National Institute for Health Care
Reform, is a longitudinal study of twelve nation-
ally representative large metropolitan commun-
ities that have been visited approximately every
two years since 1996. The seventh round of site
visits, conducted March­October 2010, involved
539 interviews with local health care leaders in
the twelve communities: Boston, Massachusetts;
Cleveland, Ohio; Greenville, South Carolina;
Indianapolis, Indiana; Lansing, Michigan; Little
Rock, Arkansas; Miami, Florida; northern New
Jersey; Orange County, California; Phoenix, Ari-
zona; Seattle, Washington; and Syracuse,
New York.5
This article is based on interviews in each site
conducted with leaders of three to four major
hospitals--typically the chief executive officer,
chief financial officer, chief medical officer,
and medical staff president of each institution.
In each site we also interviewed leaders of two to
three physician groups and major health plans--
typically the provider network manager, market-
ing head, and medical director.
Additional information was provided by inter-
views with state policy makers and knowledge-
able market observers, such as local university
faculty members and health care consultants. In
the interviews, we asked general questions about
the dynamics of contract negotiations and spe-
cific ones about payment methods and negoti-
ated rates.
Two researchers conducted each interview.
Their notes were transcribed, jointly reviewed
for validation, then entered into a database using
the research software Atlas.ti, version 5.0, and
coded to facilitate review. Atlas.ti aids in the
organization and management of transcribed
interview data for qualitative analysis.
With few exceptions, we learned that Medicare
Advantage plans pay provider rates at or close to
fee-for-service Medicare rates. Similarly, Medic-
aid managed care plan payments are close to the
relatively low Medicaid fee-for-service rates. Ac-
cordingly, the findings are relevant to provider
leverage in contract negotiations related to com-
mercial insurance products, but not to managed
care in Medicare and Medicaid.
Study Results
Market Variations In Hospital Leverage
Although there was an overall trend favoring
hospitals across the twelve markets, there is
much variation concerning which party--plans
or hospitals--was perceived as having the upper
hand in negotiations. In most markets, so-called
must-have hospitals have long had negotiating
leverage over health plans. Studied markets with
particularly dominant hospitals include Boston,
northern New Jersey, Greenville, and Cleveland.
In general, the clout derived from must-have sta-
tus has increased over the past three years.
Even in markets with dominant Blue Cross
Blue Shield plans--in our sample, these markets
included Boston, Greenville, Indianapolis, Little
Rock, Lansing, and Syracuse--respondents
thought that hospital negotiating strength was
growing. Perhaps more important, dominant
Blue Cross Blue Shield plans were perceived as
not using all of their potential bargaining power.
In other markets the picture was mixed,
although with a general trend favoring hospitals,
especially those organized into multihospital
systems.
Across all twelve markets, intramarket varia-
tions in negotiating leverage were substantial.
Respondents described "tiers" of hospitals based
on their negotiating leverage, although the de-
marcations between tiers were not always
clear-cut.
The top tier--the must-haves--had substantial
leverage over prices and related contract terms
and conditions. The second tier included hospi-
tals with particular attributes--for example, a

unique service, such as organ transplantation.
Despite their special attributes, second-tier hos-
pitals possessed leverage that remained below
that of the must-have hospital tier.
The third tier included stand-alone, commu-
nity hospitals that generally lacked leverage and
accepted rates near Medicare levels. Safety-net
hospitals with a small percentage of privately
insured patients--sometimes in the single dig-
its--generally had little clout with health plans,
unless they had a level 1 trauma center or similar
highly specialized service that was provided to
the whole community.
Although this study did not gather data on
actual payment rates, other studies have found
substantial variation within markets and across
institutions in the various tiers.6,7 One factor that
may mitigate pricing variations resulting from
differential hospital clout is that some payers
believe there is value in maintaining alternatives
to powerful hospital systems. An Indianapolis
respondent observed that health plans attempt
to "keep the small providers alive so there is less
consolidation." Similarly, a respondent from a
second-tier hospital indicated that health plans
want to keep his hospital reasonably strong to
maintain alternatives to the dominant hospital
system.
Reasons For Growing Hospital Leverage
Although policy research tends to emphasize
the importance of hospital consolidation as
the driver of increased hospital leverage, we
found that factors unrelated to consolidation
also mattered. Of critical importance was em-
ployer resistance to choice-limiting networks
with few providers, a continuing response to
the managed care backlash of the late 1990s.
Without a credible threat of excluding a provider
from their networks, health plans lack an impor-
tant bargaining chip, study respondents said.
Additionally, in areas where bed supply is tight,
hospitals can be more demanding because not
contracting with an insurer--other than a dom-
inant one--poses less risk of unfilled beds.
Reputation was another key source of lever-
age. In the words of an executive from a powerful
hospital system, "We have clout not because of
our size but [because of] who we are. Am I sup-
posed to apologize for that?" And a Blue Cross
Blue Shield executive observed, "Hospitals have
power--at least the brand names do; others
don't."
In many cases, hospitals that gain must-have
status on the basis of theirbrand are well-known,
research-oriented, academic health centers,
such as Partners Healthcare, in Boston; the Uni-
versity of Washington Medical Center, in Seattle;
and Indiana University Health, formerly Clarian
Health, in Indianapolis. However, nonacademic
hospitals also can achieve valued-brand status,
as Hoag Memorial Hospital Presbyterian in Or-
ange County and the Swedish system in Seattle
have done.
Respondents also suggested that providing an
important, unique service increased a hospital's
negotiating leverage for all of the services it pro-
vides. With only rare exceptions in the twelve
sites, academic health centers now have leverage
because their expertise at tertiary and
quaternary care is mostly unrivaled by other area
hospitals. Because employers require a broad
choice of providers for their employees, most
academic health centers now have the leverage
to require that their contracts cover all services,
rather than only specialized services, as was
common in the 1990s.
Respondents also indicated that additional
leverage could be gained by any hospital that
provided specialized services otherwise unavail-
able or limited in the market, including a child-
ren's hospital or a neonatal intensive care unit, a
designated level 1 trauma center, or a designated
organ transplant or burn center. The unique
characteristics of hospital markets also can be
important. For instance, at the time of the inter-
views, four competing downtown hospitals in
Syracuse provided different sets of services, so
plans omitting any hospital from their networks
might experience a serious gap in network cover-
age for particular services.8
Respondents also thought that relative geo-
graphic isolation can give hospitals leverage be-
cause health plans now are reluctant to ask
enrollees to travel far to seek routine or even
specialized hospital care. This can be particularly
important in relatively large, spread-out geo-
graphic areas, such as the Phoenix metropolitan
area.

flected in standard measures of concentration.

growth in multihospital health care systems,
achieved through mergers and acquisitions of
noncompeting hospitals located in different
markets.9
Although there are purported efficiencies of
such consolidation and better access to capital
to support technology enhancements, a multi-
hospital system clearly benefits by negotiating
a single contract on behalf of all its hospitals,
obtaining higher payment rates by doing so.10
Forming and extending multihospital systems
is sometimes characterized as a defensive mea-
sure to counteract health plan leverage: "So [the
insurers] can't beat up on us," as one hospital
respondent argued.
From an antitrust perspective, it is important
to emphasize that many multihospital systems
extend over broad geographic areas and have
escaped antitrust scrutiny because their mergers
do not result in excessive concentration in any of
their geographic service areas.10 Numerous par-
ticipants in contract negotiations between
health plans and hospitals noted that provider
leverage depends on how big the hospital or hos-
pital system is and how much of an insurer's
patient volume it generates.
According to study respondents, multihospital
systems with varying degrees of leverage now
dominate health delivery in most of the twelve
markets. They include national, for-profit chains
such as Tenet Healthcare and HCA Healthcare,
which have hospitals in Orange County and Mi-
ami, respectively, and other national systems,
including Catholic Health Initiatives in Little
Rock. National chains typically negotiate with
national insurers for all of their hospitals.
More common than the national chains are
regionally based, nonprofit multihospital sys-
tems, often serving an extensive geographic area
within a state or, in some cases, nearby states as
well. Across the twelve sites, important multi-
hospital systems included Baptist Health South
Florida in Miami; Banner Health in Phoenix;
Atlantic Health System and Saint Barnabas
Health Care System in northern New Jersey;
Greenville Hospital System University Medical
Center and Spartanburg Regional in South Caro-
lina; St. Joseph Health System and Memorial
Care Health System in Orange County; Cleveland
Clinic and University Hospitals in Cleveland; and
Indiana University Health and St. Vincent
Health, which is part of Ascension Health, in
Indianapolis.
The factors that contribute to increased hos-
pital leverage are mutually reinforcing and, from
the health plan perspective, can produce a daunt-
ing contracting challenge. For example, Baptist
Health was described by Miami market respon-
dents as having great clout because it is a multi-
hospital system covering a large geographic area
in south Dade County with little direct competi-
tion from other hospitals. In addition, the sys-
tem has a strong reputation and provides state-
of-the-art care rivaling the area's academic
health center, the University of Miami Hospital.
Some Physicians Seek To Consolidate In
the Community Tracking Study, we found that
it was common for small physician practices to
be price takers. Health plans typically send small
practices a fee schedule as "take it or leave it." In
contrast, respondents reported that large physi-
cian groups, whether single specialty or multi-
specialty, have leverage in such negotiations be-
cause their absence from a network would
noticeably reduce the network's attractiveness.
This dynamic provides an incentive for small
physician practices to merge.
Another important motivation for mergers is
to have enough size and scope to provide profit-
able ancillary services--such as imaging--within
the practice. In so doing, practices can take ad-
vantage of the in-office ancillary services excep-
tion to the self-referral restrictions that prohibit
doctors from referring patients to entities in
which they have a financial interest.
Physicians have been merging into larger
groups with clout over the past decade. Such
mergers currently represent important trends
in Miami, Syracuse, Phoenix, and Orange
County, which are all markets in which the dom-
inant practice mode historically had been small,
independent practices. Nevertheless, most
physicians in markets that retain an orientation
to independent, private practice continue that
practice style despite the lack of leverage it pro-
vides. In these markets, respondents said most
physicians chose neither the merged, single-
specialty group route nor hospital employment.
Another approach to consolidation that physi-
cians use to gain negotiating strength is to ride
the negotiating coattails of hospitals. Physicians
are integrated with hospitals through closely af-
filiated medical foundations in California11 and
physician-hospital organizations elsewhere.
Respondents confirmed that in most of the
twelve markets, hospitals have increased the

Providers: Market Power

number of physicians they employ over the past
three years. By employing physicians, hospitals
can build referral bases to increase their market
shares. Doing so supports service-line strategies
that require dedicated physician personnel12 and
positions the hospital to respond to expected
bundled payments and opportunities to contract
as accountable care organizations.
Respondents from health plans and provider
organizations agreed that hospitals negotiating
on behalf of their employed physicians are able
to obtain higher prices for physician services
than can be achieved by independent physician
practices. Some plan respondents reported that
having a large employed physician contingent
also increased hospital leverage over rates for
hospital services.
Physicians can also consolidate by forming
multispecialty group practices. A number of
Community Tracking Study sites have strong,
independent multispecialty group practices,
such as the Cleveland Clinic in Ohio and the
Summit Medical Group in northern New Jersey.
These organizations typically have market power
because they are viewed as must-have entities in
their local markets as a result of strong reputa-
tions for quality. However, as in previous rounds
of the Community Tracking Study site visits,
respondents did not report new efforts to form
multispecialty groups.
An alternative form of physician integration is
represented by independent practice associa-
tions, exemplified in the study markets by Mon-
arch HealthCare Medical Group in Orange
County and Mount Auburn Cambridge Indepen-
dent Practice Association in Boston. In general,
independent practice associations represent in-
dependent physician practices in negotiating
risk-bearing contracts with health maintenance
organizations.
Since the 1990s Federal Trade Commission
policy has promoted the creation of such organ-
izations because of their potential to increase the
quality and efficiency of health care--even at the
expense of a potential increase in market power
by physicians.13 The Federal Trade Commission
has given independent practice associations an
opportunity to seek so-called clinical integration
designation, which in turn gives independent
practice associations greater opportunity to re-
present their members in contract negotiations
with health plans, such as in preferred provider
organization arrangements--even though the
independent practice association is not taking
financial risk--and may also permit them to
negotiate contracts for preferred provider
organization enrollees, for whom they do not
take risk.
Health Plans Resigned To Limitations Ac-
cording to both plan and provider representa-
tives we interviewed, health plans have not re-
cently been aggressive in negotiations with
powerful providers. Rather, they have attempted
to keep low their payments to hospitals with little
negotiating leverage, partly to compensate for
high payments to must-have providers.
Terms such as truce and détente were used to
describe the current state of relations between
health plans and powerful hospitals across the
Community Tracking Study markets. As a
respondent from a must-have hospital said, Blue
Cross Blue Shield is "such a big player and we are
such a big player--we have to come to terms."
In short, to a large extent, health plans have
accepted the reality of provider leverage and its
effects on employer health care costs. An inter-
viewee in the Boston market observed, "There is
a dynamic in the market that makes it impossible
for a private payer to change anything. They [the
insurers] never recovered from Tufts [Health
Plan] trying to take on Partners and getting
beaten down. It scared everyone off.... It showed
that employers would not support plans in show-
downs against hospital systems."
Community Tracking Study markets vary in
the degree of competition among health plans.
Some markets, such as Seattle, Orange County,
and Phoenix, have multiple competing health
plans with large but not dominant market
shares. In other sites, Blue Cross Blue Shield
plans have long-standing, dominant market
positions covering more than 60 percent of
the employer-sponsored--fully insured and
self-insured--business. In Boston, Greenville,
Lansing, Little Rock, and Syracuse, the Blue
Cross Blue Shield plan is a state-based, nonprofit
plan; in Indianapolis, it is the national, publicly
traded Anthem Blue Cross Blue Shield plan.
These dominant purchasers should be in a
somewhat better position to resist even powerful
providers' demands for rate increases. However,
some respondents suggested that even dominant
BlueCrossBlueShield plans arehesitantto nego-
tiate aggressively with providers. According to
one Indianapolis provider, Anthem is in a posi-
tion to "dictate prices," but it doesn't because it

just needs "to do better than the competition."
Reported price increases for hospitals in
recent years typically have been in the high
single digits--although sometimes substantially
more--in most of the twelve markets, which ex-
ceeds increases in hospital costs of caring for
privately insured patients in all markets. Accord-
ing to an interviewee in Lansing, Michigan,
"Blue Cross Blue Shield has this deep and abid-
ing truce with hospitals: `you take what we give
you, and we won't make your life difficult.'" Ac-
cording to a Little Rock hospital interviewee,
Blue Cross Blue Shield "has the leverage, but
we get double-digit price increases."
Dominant Blue Cross Blue Shield plans may
even adopt a protective attitude toward some
hospitals. A Blue Cross Blue Shield executive
noted, "It makes our job even harder because
we have such a big impact [on] them financially
because of that [large] footprint. If we had 5 per-
cent of the market, I think our negotiations
would be easier."
Respondents suggested that, because they ef-
fectively lack competition, dominant Blue Cross
Blue Shield plans can accommodate substantial
price increases and pass them on in the form of
higher premiums. In Michigan, this approach
was formalized in most-favored-nation clauses
in contracts with hospitals, committing the hos-
pitals to give Blue Cross Blue Shield of Michigan
lower rates than competing insurers. The De-
partment of Justice recently filed suit against
Blue Cross Blue Shield of Michigan, alleging that
it paid some hospitals higher rates in return for
the hospitals' charging competing plans even
higher rates, potentially raising prices for
everyone.14
In Indianapolis, state legislation in 2007
banned the use of most-favored-nation clauses,
but Anthem reportedly still obtains the best rates
in negotiations. In other communities, includ-
ing Syracuse and Indianapolis, it appears that
the dominant Blue Cross Blue Shield plan effec-
tively obtains the best rates from hospitals in the
absence of explicit most-favored-nation contract
language.
Possible Changes In The Contracting En-
vironment Although many providers predicted
a tougher negotiating climate going forward,
respondents from some hospitals and large
physician groups remained confident that their
enhanced and growing market power would
withstand the anticipated increased pressure
placed on insurers by employers to hold the line
on rising costs. For their part, health plans were
more skeptical than providers that plans could
drive a harder bargain, given the forces moving
to buttress the position of powerful hospital sys-
tems and large physician groups and the contin-
uing preference of employers for broad
networks.
Few interviewees thought that the Affordable
Care Act per se would do much to alter current
market dynamics related to leverage. Although
some thought that the law's provision giving
more authority to state insurance commis-
sioners to review and approve premium in-
creases might result in somewhat greater health
plan resolve in negotiations, few mentioned this
as a game changer. Rather, hospitals weremostly
concerned that health reform would shift their
payer mix and result in their serving more pa-
tients enrolled in Medicaid, which pays less than
employer-sponsored plans,and thathealth plans
choosing to participate in health insurance ex-
changes would peg their rates much closer to
those of Medicaid than to those of employer-
sponsored plans.
Thus, although acknowledging that they
would see a large decrease in uncompensated
care burden, hospitals also were concerned that
aggregate payment rates would drop as a result
of the shift in payer mix. In short, they expected
that they would need to continue to exercise
leverage to obtain favorable rates from em-
ployer-sponsored coverage.
Discussion
We found that hospitals and physicians overall
gained increased negotiating leverage over
health plans for numerous reasons. Providers
with clout probably will attempt to increase rates
even more for employer-sponsored coverage,
leading to increased public policy attention to
provider pricing power.
Our findings did not suggest that more aggres-
sive antitrust enforcement, although clearly war-
ranted in particular situations, would success-
fully restrain provider pricing power more
generally. As we emphasized, some of the rea-
sons for growing provider market power are un-
related to consolidation.

is the multihospital system extending across
large geographic areas, which in most cases does
not lead to antitrust scrutiny. As a practical mat-
ter, hospital mergers within a local market area
have already been accomplished. Additional
mergers within primary service areas since the
previous round of site visits were rare, and hos-
pitals are giving much more attention to inte-
grating with physicians through employment.
Section 1003 of the Affordable Care Act added
Section 2794 to the Public Health Service Act of
1944, including a provision that requires state
insurance departments to conduct an annual re-
view of "unreasonable" increases in health insur-
ance premiums, defined through regulation as
an increase of 10 percent or more. Health insur-
ers must justify premium increases, which
means that theoretically, large payment rate in-
creases in provider contracts could lead to dis-
approval of the premium increase. At the very
least, we believe that the enhanced transparency
of negotiated rates and increased scrutiny of
health plan rate increases will raise the profile
of providerprices and could lead to public calls to
restrain provider pricing.
More concretely, increased recognition of the
role of provider pricing in rising health spending
could stimulate both market-oriented and regu-
latory responses. Market-oriented approaches
are generally based on benefit designs that make
consumers more aware of costs and give them
direct incentives to select low-cost options. How-
ever, these approaches, such as tiered networks,
have been discussed for many years and are pro-
ceeding slowly. And as we found in our site visits,
to frustrate the adoption of tiered networks,
some providers use their negotiating power to
prevent placement in a disadvantageous tier.
Nevertheless, renewed employer willingness to
support choice-limiting networks with few pro-
viders could help balance negotiating leverage
between providers and health plans.15
Alternatively, in the face of rising premiums,
employers unwilling to adopt more restrictive
benefit designs might support more direct regu-
lation of provider rates, perhaps setting upper
bounds on permissible rates negotiated between
health plans and providers in relation to Medi-
care rates.16 Although such an approach has the
virtue of regulatory simplicity, it would not per-
mit tailoring payments to individual hospital cir-
cumstances, such as the hospital's payer mix.
Alternatively, employers could push state gov-
ernments to "reinvent" provider rate setting. In
its heyday in the 1970s and early 1980s, more
than thirty states were involved in reviewing or
actually regulating hospital payment rates for all
public and private payers.17 A few states--includ-
ing Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey, West
Virginia, and New York--had functioning, rea-
sonably successful all-payer programs. Although
most of these states have since ended those pro-
grams, Maryland and West Virginia's rate setting
program continues.
Some current policy wisdom assumes that this
form of price regulation failed and therefore fell
into disfavor. However, research suggests that
some states with mandatory controls on hospital
rates were able to reduce their rates of growth in
per discharge and per capita inpatient costs rel-
ative to states with voluntary, weak, or no
controls.17
Conclusion
Although the broad trend of provider consolida-
tion is a major factor in the growth of hospital
and physician-group negotiating leverage with
health plans, a number of other factors, individu-
ally or in combination, also have contributed to
high payment rate increases. Findings from the
Community Tracking Study suggest that the
sources of negotiating leverage for providers
in the contracting process are more nuanced
than previous discussions would suggest.
Although some policy analysts believe that more
intensive state review of commercial insurer re-
quests for premium rate increases would indi-
rectly exert downward pressure on provider
rates, our findings indicate that a range of other
market and regulatory approaches also need to
be examined in any attempt to address the
consequences of growing provider leverage.

Wood Johnson Foundation and the

ABOUT THE AUTHORS: ROBERT A. BERENSON, PAUL B. GINSBURG,
JON B. CHRISTIANSON & TRACY YEE
Robert A. Berenson
is an Institute
Fellow at the Urban
Institute.
In this month's Health Affairs,
Robert Berenson and coauthors
draw on interviews conducted as
part of the long-term Community
Tracking Study in analyzing the
ability of some hospital systems
and large physician group practices
to demand higher prices from
commercial health plans. The
reasons for this market clout vary,
but, in general, insurers have not
been successful in resisting the
higher rates. The authors suggest
that a range of market and
regulatory approaches may need to
be brought to bear on the issue--
including the spread of employer
benefit plans designed to
encourage the use of the lowest-
cost high-quality hospitals.
