We propose a model wherein chronic stress results in glucocorticoid
receptor resistance (GCR) that, in turn, results in failure to down-
regulate inflammatory response. Here we test the model in two
viral-challenge studies. In study 1, we assessed stressful life events,
GCR, and control variables including baseline antibody to the chal-
lenge virus, age, body mass index (BMI), season, race, sex, educa-
tion, and virus type in 276 healthy adult volunteers. The volunteers
were subsequently quarantined, exposed to one of two rhinovi-
ruses, and followed for 5 d with nasal washes for viral isolation
and assessment of signs/symptoms of a common cold. In study 2,
we assessed the same control variables and GCR in 79 subjects who
were subsequently exposed to a rhinovirus and monitored at base-
line and for 5 d after viral challenge for the production of local (in
nasal secretions) proinflammatory cytokines (IL-1, TNF-, and IL-6).
Study 1: After covarying the control variables, those with recent
exposure to a long-term threatening stressful experience demon-
strated GCR; and those with GCR were at higher risk of subsequently
developing a cold. Study 2: With the same controls used in study 1,
greater GCR predicted the production of more local proinflamma-
tory cytokines among infected subjects. These data provide support
for a model suggesting that prolonged stressors result in GCR,
which, in turn, interferes with appropriate regulation of inflamma-
tion. Because inflammation plays an important role in the onset and
progression of a wide range of diseases, this model may have broad
implications for understanding the role of stress in health.
lymphocytes | receptor sensitivity | psychological stress | cortisol |
hypothalamic­pituitary­adrenocortical axis
Chronic psychological stress is associated with a greater risk of
depression, cardiovascular disease (CVD), diabetes, autoim-
mune diseases, upper respiratory infections (URIs), and poorer
wound healing (1). Although these associations are often attrib-
uted to stress-induced dysregulation of the hypothalamic­pitui-
tary­adrenocortical axis (HPA) (e.g., refs. 2, 3), few human studies
include assessments of stressful events, HPA response, and a dis-
ease outcome in the same subjects. The lack of such studies is partly
attributable to the as yet incomplete understanding of the effects of
prolonged stress on the HPA in human subjects (4) and on de-
termining which stress-induced changes in HPA play a downstream
role in disease risk. The simple notion that chronic stress acts
through the direct effects of elevated circulating cortisol is be-
coming less likely (5, 6). What may matter more is how target tis-
sues respond to cortisol, rather than levels of the hormone per se.
GCR refers to a decrease in the sensitivity of immune cells to
glucocorticoid hormones that normally terminate the inflammatory
response (6­9). Evidence for GCR in response to chronic stress
has been found in parents of children with cancer (10), spouses of
brain-cancer patients (11) and in persons reporting high levels of
loneliness (5). Without sufficient glucocorticoid regulation, the
duration and/or intensity of the inflammatory response increases,
heightening risk for acute exacerbations such as occur in asthma
and autoimmune diseases, as well as for the onset and progression
of chronic inflammatory diseases such as CVD, and type II di-
abetes (12).
In the common cold, the typical signs and symptoms of illness
are primarily caused by the release of the proinflammatory cyto-
kines produced in response to infection (13). A series of studies
have shown that chronic stress is associated with increased sus-
ceptibility to developing a common cold among persons experi-
mentally exposed to an upper respiratory virus (e.g., refs. 14­17).
This association has been replicated in cross-sectional and pro-
spective studies conducted in natural settings (18). Although
attempts to identify behavioral pathways linking stress to cold
susceptibility have not been especially successful (14, 15), there is
evidence consistent with stress effects resulting in increased dis-
ease risk because of their association with exaggerated local (in
the nose) release of inflammatory cytokines (16). The explanation
for this association has been that stress disrupts the HPA response
and that the regulation of inflammation is under HPA control.
However, cortisol levels based on 24-h urine (15) and waking di-
urnal assessments in saliva (19, 20) do not play a part in this
process. Alternatively, what matters may be how the target tissue
responds to cortisol, rather than the levels of the hormone per se.
To the extent that chronic stress results in GCR, one might expect
insufficient control over the inflammatory response to the in-
fection, and consequently a greater expression of the signs and
symptoms of disease.
The viral-challenge paradigm provides an ideal context to study
the general model of stress leading to disease via effects on the
HPA and inflammatory regulation. In these studies, stress and
GCR are assessed before subjects are exposed to a virus and fol-
lowed in quarantine to determine whether they develop a clinical
illness (infection plus signs of illness). Here we conduct secondary
analyses of two independent studies (15, 21), each using a different
means of assessing GCR, to address the potential role of target
tissue sensitivity to cortisol in linking stress to disease. In study 1,
we attempt to replicate earlier evidence that stress exposure is
associated with increased GCR (5, 6, 9­11) and test whether GCR
prospectively predicts who will develop a cold when exposed to
a rhinovirus. In study 2, we address whether GCR is prospectively
associated with the magnitude of the local inflammatory cytokine
response to being infected by a cold virus. We predict that GCR
will be associated with experiencing a long-term threatening
stressful experience, will interfere with the down-regulation of
proinflammatory cytokine response, and will increase illness ex-
pression among persons infected with a cold virus.

Results
All analyses include seven covariates: prechallenge viral-specific
antibody titers, age, body mass index [BMI: weight (kg)/height
(m)2], season (spring or fall), race (white or not), sex, and edu-
cation (study 1: less than high school, high school graduate, some
college, bachelor's degree or greater; study 2: years of educa-
tion). In study 1, where subjects receive one of two viruses,
analyses also control for virus type [rhinovirus (RV)21 or RV39].
Study 1. Stress and colds. As reported in similar analyses of these
data (14), in a multiple logistic regression, exposure to a recent
major stressful life event was associated with an increased risk
for developing a cold following exposure to RV (OR = 1.99,
CI = 1.04, 3.08). This association was similar across the two
viruses (P > 0.16 for stress-by-virus interaction).
Stress, GCR, and colds. Greater levels of glucocorticoid are associated
with higher numbers of circulating neutrophils, lower numbers
of circulating lymphocytes, and a lower neutrophil-to-lymphocyte
(N/L) ratio--an overall marker of the trafficking of these cells (e.g.,
refs. 22, 23). Cole and his colleagues (5, 24) showed that this as-
sociation can be used to indirectly assess GCR. The logic of the
measure is that there is a strong physiologic correlation between
cortisol levels and the number of circulating leukocytes only if
leukocyte glucocorticoid receptors are sensitive (i.e., signaling cells
to redistribute).
Stress and GCR. We found the expected associations between
leukocyte numbers and cortisol among those who did not expe-
rience a major stressor (n = 83). In contrast, consistent with the
hypothesis that stress results in GCR, there were no associations
between cortisol and leukocytes among those who did experience
a stressor (n = 193). Fig. 1 displays these findings graphically
using the relation of cortisol to N/L ratio as an example. That the
slopes of the stressed and nonstressed subjects were different
from each other is supported by stress-by-cortisol level inter-
actions found in linear regressions predicting lymphocytes (P =
0.03), neutrophils (P = 0.03) and the N/L ratio (P = 0.03). For
all three analyses, simple slopes for those without stress were
significantly different from 0, whereas slopes for those with stress
were not (Table 1). These analyses support GCR emergence
among those experiencing major stressors.
GCR and colds. Similarly we find the expected associations between
cortisol and leukocyte counts for persons who did not develop
a cold following viral challenge (n = 167). In contrast, and con-
sistent with GCR putting people at greater risk for illness, there
were no associations between cortisol and leukocyte counts
among those who did develop a cold (n = 109). (Fig. 2, N/L ratio.)
Here linear regressions indicate stress-by-cortisol interactions for
lymphocytes (P = 0.02), neutrophils (marginal at P = 0.08), and
N/L ratio (P = 0.02). For all three analyses, simple slopes among
those who did not develop a cold were significantly different from
0, whereas slopes for those who did develop a cold were not
(Table 2). As expected, plasma cortisol levels did not predict who
developed a cold (OR = 1.27, CI = 0.20, 7.94). Together, results
from these prospective analyses support the hypothesis that GCR
predicts an increased risk for colds following viral exposure,
whereas levels of circulating cortisol do not.
Consideration of alternative explanations. To evaluate the possibility
that sympathetic nervous system hormones that often increase
with cortisol may be driving the redistribution of cells, we con-
ducted all of the same analyses described earlier replacing cor-
tisol with epinephrine (E) and with norepinephrine (NE). These
hormones were not associated with numbers of any of the cell
types in relevant subgroups of subjects defined by either stress
or colds.
Study 2. GCR and nasal cytokines. We suggest that the association of
GCR with colds reflects inadequate control of local inflammatory
responses to the virus. To test this hypothesis, we examine
whether GCR predicts the production of local proinflammatory
cytokines when subjects are exposed to a rhinovirus. Data for this
study were collected from a subsample of subjects in a larger viral-
challenge trial (15). Here GCR was assessed before viral chal-
lenge using a standard ex vivo model (6), wherein leukocytes were
coincubated with lipopolysaccharide and dexamethasone, and
proinflammatory cytokine production measured in supernatants.
The logic behind this assay is that dexamethasone should inhibit
cytokine production only to the extent that leukocytes are sensi-
tive to its effects. This study had enough subjects with the required
data to examine cytokine response (a continuous variable) but not
colds (a dichotomous outcome).

Table 3 presents the partial correlations between GCR and
proinflammatory cytokine levels in the nasal cavity during the 5 d
following viral challenge. For both IL-6 and TNF-, increases in
the resistance curve were associated with increased production of
the matching local inflammatory cytokine. Greater IL-1 GCR
was also associated with greater local IL-6 production. The cor-
relation of IL-1 GCR with local IL-1 release was in the expected
direction, but was not significant. All of these results are the same
whether the analyses include all subjects, or are limited to those
infected by the virus. Cortisol levels as assessed by multiple sam-
ples of saliva collected across the day before viral challenge were
unrelated to any of the three GCR measures (all P > 0.20) or to
proinflammatory cytokine levels (all P > 0.40). Overall, these data
are consistent with the hypothesis that a decreased sensitivity of
leukocytes to the inhibitory effects of cortisol (increased GCR)
reflects a decreased ability of cortisol to regulate the production of
local proinflammatory cytokines in response to infection.
Discussion
We proposed that exposure to a major stressful life event can result
in GCR, which, in turn, would interfere with HPA down-regulation
of local proinflammatory cytokine response to an infectious agent.
Without appropriate cortisol regulation of the local cytokine re-
sponse, there would be an exaggerated expression of the signs of
URI, which are generated by the proinflammatory response. In
study 1, stress--defined as a recent stressful life experience asso-
ciated with long-term threat--predicted an increased risk of
developing a cold following exposure to a rhinovirus (also reported
in ref. 15). New analyses indicate that this same stress measure
was also associated with GCR, with stressed persons showing less
sensitivity of lymphocyte and neutrophil counts to distributional
changes associated with greater circulating levels of cortisol. In
turn, GCR was prospectively associated with increased risk of
developing a common cold following experimental inoculation
with a cold virus. These data are consistent with a model wherein
stress leads to GCR, which in turn results in greater risk for de-
veloping a cold. In study 2, GCR predicted how much local
proinflammatory cytokine was produced in response to infection.
Because the analyses in both studies were prospective, we can
eliminate reverse causation (colds did not cause stress, colds did
not cause GCR, and cytokine release did not cause GCR) as an
alternative explanation. The use of multiple control variables also
eliminates many potential spurious explanations.
The GCR measure used in study 1 is indirect. However, exper-
imental studies have shown that glucocorticoid-induced leukocyte
redistribution is specifically attributable to glucocorticoid receptor
signaling (25), and that the indirect assessment used here corre-
lates with blunting of lymphocyte redistribution in response to
dexamethasone injection (24). Even so, it is possible that the action
of another hormone or mechanism both highly correlated with
cortisol and having the same impact on leukocyte trafficking as
cortisol could account for these effects. Likely alternative explan-
ations include that the associations are attributable to subject
health (e.g., infections) or to receptor sensitivity to E and/or NE.
Health is not an issue here, because subjects are carefully
screened for excellent health. Further, we found that neither E
nor NE were correlated with leukocyte counts under any of the
relevant conditions (similar results in ref. 5). We also found
consistent evidence across studies 1 and 2, even though study 2
used a standard direct assessment of GCR.
We found no effects of cortisol levels on disease risk (e.g., refs.
19, 20), GCR, or inflammation. This apparent lack of a role for
circulating cortisol levels is consistent with the possibility that
impaired target tissue response to the regulatory effects of this
hormone may overshadow any modulatory influences that might
result from changes in circulating concentrations of cortisol itself.

In the case of the common cold, a disease for which expression
of the signs/symptoms of illness is driven by the inflammatory
response, the failure of the HPA to regulate the production of
local proinflammatory cytokines contributes to the risk for clinical
illness. Because inflammation plays a role in progression of mul-
tiple diseases, this model not only provides an explanation for the
increased risk for URI under stress, but might provide a more
general explanation for why prolonged stress would play a role in
other inflammatory diseases as well. Moreover, although the focus
here has been on GCR in circulating leukocytes and neutrophils,
stress could also be associated with illness expression through its
effect on the glucocorticoid sensitivity of other cells involved in
immune defenses (26). For example, glucocorticoid receptors (GR)
are expressed by cells involved with antigen presentation, such as
dendrocytes and macrophages, not only in circulation but also at
specific sites of infection and in draining lymph nodes.
Parodoxically, proinflammatory cytokines are thought to both
up-regulate immunity to the virus and produce cold symptoms
(13). However, here stress and GCR, conditions associated with
increased levels of local proinflammatory cytokine, predicted a
greater risk of clinical illness. These data are consistent with
those of other viral-challenge studies that found a positive as-
sociation between proinflammatory cytokine levels and symptom
expression (16).
An unexplained inconsistency in the data from study 2 is that
local IL-6 and TNF-, but not IL-1, were correlated with GCR
measured by the whole blood ex vivo assay. It is possible that this
discrepancy is due to the relative insensitivity of the IL-1 assay.
Alternatively, it may reflect a differential sensitivity of these
cytokines to glucocorticoid suppression (27).
Finally, future research on GCR would benefit from quanti-
fication of GR subtypes, whose relative abundance might un-
derlie the findings observed here. Chronic stress does not appear
to affect expression of GR, the active isoform of the receptor
(11). However, there is evidence linking stress and cytokines to
higher levels of GR and a lower GR/GR ratio (28). This
could prove important because GR is a dominant negative re-
ceptor for cortisol, which can suppress GR activity and thereby
contribute to GCR (28).
Methods
Study 1. Subjects and design. The subjects were 125 men and 151 women, mean
age 29.13 y (SD = 9.09 y) who responded to newspaper advertisements and
were judged to be in good health after a medical examination. Subjects
were paid $800 for their participation.
After we assessed life stress, completebloodcounts,cortisol, demographics,
anthropomorphics, and virus-specific antibody levels, subjects were quaran-
tined in separate rooms, exposed to one of two RVs and followed for 5 d with
nasal washes for viral isolation and assessment of symptoms and signs of a
common cold.
Experimental plan. At the medical screening, age, education, race, sex, body
weight, and height were also assessed and used as baseline data for those
deemed eligible. Eligible subjects returned to the hospital 4 and 5 wk later
(1­2 wk before viral challenge) for two blood samples for determination of
complete blood counts, antibody to the challenge virus, and plasma cortisol
and for the stressful life event interview.
After completing the baseline assessments, subjects entered quarantine.
During the first 24 h of quarantine (before viral challenge), they had a nasal
examination (including a nasal wash culture for RV) and were excluded if there
was any indication of recent or current URI or illness. An update stressful life
event interview was administered at this time to identify events occurring
between the initial interview and quarantine. Baseline respiratory signs (nasal
mucociliary clearance and nasal mucus production) and symptoms were
assessed. At the end of the first 24 h of quarantine, subjects were given nasal
drops containing a low infectious dose of either RV21 (N = 129) or RV39 (N =
147). Quarantine continued for 5 d after challenge. Nasal secretion samples
for virus culture were collected on each of the 5 d. Subjects were also tested
on each day for respiratory symptoms, nasal mucociliary clearance, and nasal
mucus production. Approximately 28 d postchallenge, a blood sample was
collected for assaying convalescent antibodies to the challenge virus. All
investigators were blinded to subjects' status on all baseline assessments.
Stressful life events. Life events were assessed by a standardized semistructured
interview, the Bedford College Life Events and Difficulties Schedule (LEDS)
(29), and conducted by trained interviewers. We considered only those events
that occurred during the last 12 mo. Ratings of events were performed in an
independent laboratory by consensus groups consisting of at least four
trained interviewers. The interview staff was blind to other study measures.
Raters were also blind to individuals' subjective responses to the stressful
events and used "dictionaries" of precedent examples to rate each stressful
experience reported during the interview on long-term threat (i.e., threat
that is sustained beyond the immediate experience of the event). Dictionary
ratings are based on the likely response of an average person to a stressor
occurring in the context of the subject's particular set of biographical cir-
cumstances. It is the long-term threat of an experience that is thought to
determine its implications for health. Here, we define stress as a life experi-
ence, irrespective of duration (including both acute events and chronic dif-
ficulties in LEDS parlance), that was rated as having high moderate or marked
long-term threat. We excluded stress resulting from physical illness to avoid
confounding a chronic health condition with susceptibility and stressful
events in which the subject was not a major focus.
GCR. We conducted a complete blood count and assayed for cortisol in each of
twobloodsamplescollected1and2wkprechallenge.Correlationsbetweencell
counts from the two blood draws ranged from 0.61 to 0.76, P < 0.001. Plasma
cortisol was measured using a double-antibody competitive RIA. The correla-
tion between cortisol in the two samples was 0.70, P < 0.001. Because we were
concerned with stable differences in cortisol and in cell distributions that occur
in response to prolonged stress, we averaged the two values in both cases.

are therefore based on the associations of cortisol with percentages of lym-
phocytes and neutrophils. We also use the ratio of neutrophils to lymphocytes
(log10
) as an overall marker of the trafficking of these cells (5, 24).
Epinephrine and Norepinephrine. Urine was obtained from 24-h collections that
began on day 0 of quarantine. E and NE were measured using high per-
formance liquid chromatography with electrochemical detection. Values are
expressed in micrograms per milligram of creatinine (log10
).
Infection. Nasal washes were performed daily during quarantine to provide
samples of nasal secretions for virus culture (30). Neutralizing antibodies to
the challenge virus were tested in prechallenge and 28-d postchallenge se-
rum samples (30).
Signs of illness. On each day of quarantine, we collected two objective signs of
disease--mucus weights and mucociliary clearance function. Mucus weights
were determined by collecting used tissues in sealed plastic bags (31). The
bags were weighed and the weight of the tissues and bags subtracted. To

adjust for baseline, mucus weight on the day before challenge (mode = 0)
was subtracted from each daily mucus weight after challenge. Adjusted
weights with negative values were scored as 0. The adjusted postchallenge
weights were summed to create an adjusted total mucus weight.
Nasal mucociliary clearance function refers to the effectiveness of nasal cilia
in clearing mucus from the nasal passage toward the nasopharnyx. Clearance
function was assessed as thetime required foradye administered into thenose
to reach the nasopharnyx (31). Each daily time was adjusted (by subtracting)
for baseline (negative values were scored as 0) and the adjusted average time
in minutes was calculated across the postchallenge days of the trial.
Clinical illness. Subjects were considered to have a cold if they were both
infectedand metobjectiveillnesscriteria.Theywere classifiedasinfectedifthe
challenge virus was isolated onany ofthe5 postchallenge study days orifthere
was a fourfold or greater rise in virus-specific serum neutralizing antibody titer
between prechallenge and 28-d postchallenge. Illness criterion was based on
objective indicators of illness--a total adjusted mucus weight of 10 g or an
adjusted average mucociliary nasal clearance time of 7 min (21).
Statistical analyses. We conducted two sets of regression analyses, each pre-
dicting the percentage of neutrophils, lymphocytes, and the N/L ratio. The
first set included the standard covariates, a dichotomous variable repre-
senting life stress (1 = stress, 0 = no stress), continuous plasma cortisol, and the
interaction of life stress and cortisol. We predicted an interaction with leu-
kocyte counts increasing (neutrophils and N/L ratio) or decreasing (lym-
phocytes) with increasing cortisol levels for those without a major stressful life
event but not for those with an event. The second set included standard
covariates, dichotomous variables for life stress, and cold status (1 = cold, 0 =
no cold) and the interaction of life stress and cold status. We again predicted
an interaction with cortisol associated with leukocyte counts among those
without colds but not among those with colds. We also calculated the simple
slopes for each group in all analyses and tested whether they were signifi-
cantly different from a slope of 0.
Study 2. Subjects and design. The subjects were 39 men and 43 women (mean
age = 36.9 y, SD = 9.2 y) who responded to advertisements and were judged to
be in good health. They were paid $800 for their participation. Three subjects
were excluded due to incomplete nasal cytokine data.
After we assessed GCR and the standard control variables, subjects were
quarantinedinseparaterooms,exposedtoarhinovirusandfollowedfor5dwith
nasal washes to assess viral shedding and local proinflammatory cytokines.
Experimental plan. At the medical screening we also collected specific serum
antibody titer to the challenge virus, demographics, weight, and height.
Because we were interested in inflammatory response to infection, we
maximized the rate of infection by including only subjects with prechallenge
viral-specific antibody titers 4.
During the first 24 h of quarantine (before viral challenge) nasal muco-
ciliary clearance and nasal mucus production were assessed. Volunteers were
excluded if they had signs or symptoms of a cold and excluded from analysis if
a viral pathogen was isolated from the nasal lavage obtained at that time.
Subjects were then given nasal drops containing an infectious dose of
RV39. On each day of quarantine nasal lavage samples were collected for
virus culture and assessment of local proinflammatory cytokines. Approxi-
mately 28 d postchallenge, blood was collected for serological testing. The
investigators were blinded to all baseline measures.
Infection. Infection was assessed with the same procedures used in study 1.
GCR. We used a standard in vitro assay to measure GCR that assessed the
ability of dexamethasone (0, 10, 50, and 250 nM) to suppress lipopolysac-
charide (30 ng/mL) stimulated lymphocyte production of IL-1, IL-6, and TNF-
. The remaining procedures were the same as those used in Miller et al. (6).
Area under the dexamethasone curve (adjusted for an unstimulated control)
was used to represent GCR.
Proinflammatory cytokines. We measured IL-1, IL-6, and TNF- in nasal secre-
tions. Nasal wash fluid was assayed for cytokine protein using the BioSource
Ten-plex bead immunoassay and methods provided by the manufacturer
(BioSource International). Assays were performed in duplicate using a Luminex
100 bead-based immunoassay system. To control for basal nasal cytokine
levels, prechallenge cytokine values were subtracted from the values obtained
on each of the 5 postchallenge days. Nasal cytokine area under the curve (AUC)
was derived from these baseline-adjusted values and computed using the
trapezoid formula.
Cortisol. Subjects provided seven saliva samples (collected at wake-up and at 1,
2, 4, 7, 9, and 14 h after wake-up) on the day preceding viral challenge by
chewing on cotton rolls until saturated and then storing the rolls in plastic
salivettes. Code numbers provided by hand-held computers were used to
guarantee timely collection of samples. Saliva cortisol level was determined
by ELISA. Log10
AUC adjusted for wake-up time was used to represent
cortisol level.
