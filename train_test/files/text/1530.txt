Previous research has identified social isolation as a risk
factor for physical and mental health problems (e.g.,
Berkman, 1995; Cacioppo & Hawkley, 2003; Cacioppo,
Hughes, Waite, Hawkley, & Thisted, 2006; House, 2001).
Socially disconnected and lonely individuals tend to suffer
higher rates of morbidity and mortality (Taylor, Repetti, &
Seeman, 1997; Thoits, 1995) as well as infection (Cohen,
Doyle, Skoner, Rabin, & Gwaltney, 1997; Pressman et al.,
2005), depression (Heikkinen & Kauppinen, 2004), and cog-
nitive decline (Wilson et al., 2007). The mere presence of
another individual can alleviate stress (Cohen & Williamson,
1991; Thoits), whereas feelings of loneliness may exacer-
bate the physiological effects of stress, resulting in elevated
cortisol levels (Hawkley, Burleson, Berntson, & Cacioppo,
2003; Steptoe, Owen, Kunz-Ebrecht, & Brydon, 2004) and
blood pressure (Hawkley et al).
The purpose of this article is to demonstrate the develop-
ment of scales capturing social disconnectedness and per-
ceived isolation using data from the National Social Life,
Health, and Aging Project (NSHAP). We use procedures of
scale construction to combine multiple indicators of isola-
tion into a scale assessing social disconnectedness and a
scale capturing perceived isolation. We then examine the
relationship between disconnectedness and perceived isola-
tion and assess their distributions across age, gender, and
self-rated health among older adults. Our aim is not to pres-
ent these scales as definitive measures but to encourage fur-
ther work toward elucidating the concept, causes, and
consequences of social isolation among older adults.
Social Isolation Among Older Adults
The examination of social isolation among older adults is
particularly important for a number of reasons. First, there
is some evidence that social isolation may become more
common with increasing age. Older adults tend to have
smaller social networks (McPherson, Smith-Lovin, &
Brashears, 2006) and are more likely to experience feelings
of loneliness (Dykstra, van Tilburg, & de Jong Gierveld,
2005). This may be due, in part, to older adults' experiences
of bereavement and their greater likelihood of living alone
(Kramarow, 1995; Li & Ferraro, 2005). The correspondence
of these conditions has led to the assumption that diminish-
ing social networks result in lower levels of perceived social
support and increased loneliness.
However, recent research suggests that changes across
the life course in social connectedness and satisfaction may
be heterogeneous. For example, data from NSHAP indicate

Objectives. The National Social Life, Health, and Aging Project (NSHAP) data contain multiple indicators of social
connectedness, social participation, social support, and loneliness among older adults. We suggest that these indicators
can be combined to measure two aspects of social isolation: social disconnectedness (i.e., physical separation from oth-
ers) and perceived isolation (i.e., feelings of loneliness and a lack of social support). We use the NSHAP data to create
scales measuring social disconnectedness and perceived isolation and examine their distribution among older adults.
Methods. We assess the reliability of the scales using Cronbach's alpha and item-total correlations and perform con-
firmatory factor analysis to test the model against the data. Finally, we test differences in scale means across subgroups
to assess the distribution of social disconnectedness and perceived isolation among older adults.
Results. We find that 17 indicators combine into two reliable scales. The social disconnectedness scale has a two-
factor structure, including the restricted social network dimension and the social inactivity dimension. The perceived
isolation scale also comprises two dimensions: lack of support and loneliness. We find that social disconnectedness does
not vary across age groups, but the oldest old feel more isolated than the young old. Social disconnectedness and per-
ceived isolation are greater among those who have worse health.
Discussion. The creation of scales measuring social disconnectedness and perceived isolation provides one way to
utilize the wide variety of indicators of social isolation collected in the NSHAP study. Although individual indicators of
social connectedness or isolation are useful in their own right, these scales provide parsimonious, continuous variables
that account for a variety of aspects of social isolation, which may be especially useful for inclusion in multivariate
analyses predicting health outcomes.

MEASURING SOCIAL ISOLATION AMONG OLDER ADULTS i39
that the oldest old have greater participation than the young
old (Cornwell, Laumann, & Schumm, 2008), and other re-
search suggests that loneliness may peak in middle age
(Carstensen, Isaacowitz, & Charles, 1999). Accordingly, so-
cial connectedness, support, and loneliness may not be inex-
tricably linked, especially among older adults. In the face of
shrinking social networks, older adults may develop closer
relationships and shift expectations so that decreasing con-
nectedness does not necessarily result in the perception of
isolation (Lang & Carstensen, 1994; Schnittker, 2007).
Finally, to the extent that social isolation is associated
with worse health, it may pose a particularly severe risk for
older adults. Older adults are more likely to experience be-
reavement and develop health problems, both of which may
increase their need for social support and companionship.
As a result, social isolation may be particularly deleterious
for older adults. Indeed, research indicates that older adults
who experience one or another aspect of isolation have been
found to be at greater risk for all-cause mortality, increased
morbidity, depression, and cognitive decline (Brummett
et al., 2001; Cacioppo & Hawkley, 2003; House, Landis, &
Umberson, 1988; Sherbourne, Meredith, Rogers, & Ware,
1992; Tomaka, Thompson, & Palacios, 2006).
Measuring Social Isolation
The variety of indicators of isolation and loneliness used
across research in different disciplines is both a blessing
and a curse. This work has captured an enormous number of
facets of individuals' everyday social worlds. Indicators of
isolation in previous research include living alone (Dean,
Kolody, Wood, & Matt, 1992; Hughes & Gove, 1981; Waite
& Hughes, 1999), being unmarried (Lillard & Waite, 1995;
Ross, 1995), having a small social network (Berkman &
Syme, 1979; Seeman, Berkman, Blazer, & Rowe, 1994),
infrequent contact with network members (Brummett et al.,
2001), a lack of social network diversity (Barefoot,
Gronbaek, Jensen, Schnohr, & Prescott, 2005), a perceived
lack of social support (Blazer, 1982; Krause, 1987; Lin, Ye,
& Ensel, 1999; Wethington & Kessler, 1986), low participa-
tion in social activities (Benjamins, 2004; Ellison & George,
1994; Thoits & Hewitt, 2001), emotionally distant relation-
ships (Uno, Uchino, & Smith, 2002), and feelings of loneli-
ness or not belonging (Cacioppo et al., 2006; Hawkley et al.,
2003). However, most of this work has been limited to the
examination of only one or two indicators of isolation (or
connectedness), or it has focused on only one conceptual
area, such as support, participation, or loneliness. As a re-
sult, it is difficult to discern whether multiple features of
isolation might combine to create particularly severe situa-
tions of social isolation among the oldest old. It is also un-
clear whether feelings of loneliness and a lack of social
support do, in fact, follow the loss of social network ties or
if more subjective appraisals of isolation are separate from
objective features of isolation.
In efforts to consolidate multiple measures of social iso-
lation, several authors have previously identified central
components of isolation. For example, van Baarsen,
Snijders, Smit, and van Duijn (2001) distinguish between
social loneliness, as the lack of integration and compan-
ionship, and emotional loneliness, as the lack of an attach-
ment figure. De Jong Gierveld and Hagestad (2006)
similarly contrast isolation (as the opposite of integration)
with loneliness (as the opposite of embeddedness). Fol-
lowing these distinctions and building from the disciplin-
ary approaches of both sociology and psychology, we
suggest two distinct aspects of social isolation. Social dis-
connectedness can be characterized by a lack of contact
with others and indicated by situational factors, such as a
small social network, infrequent interaction, and a lack of
participation in social activities and groups. Perceived iso-
lation, on the other hand, can be characterized by the sub-
jective experience of a shortfall in one's social resources
such as companionship and support. Individuals who are
socially disconnected may have small social networks, in-
teract with network members infrequently, and rarely par-
ticipate in social activities. On the other hand, individuals
who perceive themselves to be isolated may report feel-
ings of loneliness and perceive a lack of social support
from friends and family members.
Social disconnectedness and perceived isolation are re-
lated, but we hypothesize that they are distinct. Some re-
search indicates, for example, that feelings of loneliness are
responsive to changes in network size, but other findings
indicate only a modest correlation between disconnected-
ness and perceived isolation (Hawkley et al., 2003; Hughes,
Waite, Hawkley, & Cacioppo, 2004; Schnittker, 2007). Al-
though physical separation from others and feelings of
loneliness may go hand-in-hand for some individuals, infre-
quent social interaction may not lead to feelings of loneli-
ness for others. Alternatively, people who are socially active
and embedded within an expansive social network may feel
socially isolated if their relationships lack emotional close-
ness and support.
Methods
We use data from NSHAP, a nationally representative,
population-based study of community-residing older adults.
From summer 2005 to spring 2006, NSHAP conducted in-
person interviews with 3,005 individuals, ages 57­85
years. The study achieved a final weighted response rate of
75.5%. NSHAP used a modularized questionnaire design
so that some questions were included in a leave-behind
questionnaire for a randomly selected subset of respon-
dents. Detailed information about the NSHAP study design
may be found in O'Muircheartaigh, Eckman, and Smith
(in press).
NSHAP includes a wide variety of indicators of social
connectedness, support, and activity, as well as feelings
CORNWELL AND WAITE
i40
of loneliness. Measures such as network size, frequency
of interaction with network members, participation in so-
cial groups, and perceived support can be reversed to in-
dicate the lack of these social resources. We seek to
combine all these items into reliable scales of social dis-
connectedness and perceived isolation. Scale creation is
typically used to measure constructs that cannot be ade-
quately or directly assessed using one or two indicators.
Therefore, by combining indicators that theoretically co-
vary with objective isolation and subjective isolation, we
can create a parsimonious proxy measure for these two
constructs (DeVellis, 2003).
Scale Construction
We will begin by selecting items for each scale based
on their content validity, determined by previous research
suggesting that these items may be indicative of objective
or subjective isolation. Assessments of scale reliability
indicate how strongly the scale's items are correlated with
each other. Because we assume that the items in the two
scales are indicative of objective social isolation and sub-
jective social isolation, we also expect that the items
within each respective scale will be interrelated. Two
measures indicate the extent of interrelation among scale
items. First, item-rest correlations, or the correlations be-
tween each item and the set of other items included in the
scale, provide a measure of the scale's internal consis-
tency. Second, the proportion of total variation in the
scale that is shared by the included items is indicated by
Cronbach's (1951) alpha coefficient. Alpha coefficients
greater than .70 typically connote acceptable overall scale
reliability (DeVellis, 2003; Nunnally, 1978). Finally, we
examine whether the scales retain acceptable internal
consistency reliability across sociodemographic charac-
teristics.
We create the social disconnectedness and perceived iso-
lation scales by retaining items that maximize internal con-
sistency reliability. Scale scores are calculated for each
respondent by standardizing the retained items (so that
M=0 and SD=1) and dividing the sum of the standardized
values by the total number of nonmissing items.This method
enables the calculation of a valid scale score as long as a
respondent has responded to at least one item included in
the scale. Scores on each scale may then be interpreted as a
standardized variable. A score of zero indicates that the re-
spondent provided the mean response for each of the in-
cluded items. Positive scores indicate greater-than-average
isolation, whereas negative scores indicate lower-than-
average isolation.
Confirmatory Factor Analysis
We conduct confirmatory factor analysis to test the factor
structures expected to underlie each scale, as described sub-
sequently. We assess the standardized loadings for each fac-
tor, which can be interpreted as the correlations between the
observed variables and the unobserved variables. We also
consider the overall fit of each hypothesized model to the
sample using three goodness-of-fit indices. The c2 statistic
compares the tested model with a saturated model, with the
null hypothesis that the tested model is a good fit. However,
the test is sensitive to sample size (Joreskog, 1969), so this
may not be a useful indicator for the present study. The
comparative fit index indicates how well the specified model
fits compared with a baseline model. Higher values indicate
a better fit, and values above 0.90 are generally considered
to indicate a good fit (Diamantopoulos & Sigaw, 2000). The
root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA) indi-
cates the closeness of the fit of the model in relation to its
degrees of freedom. Previous research has suggested that
values less than .05 indicate a close fit (Browne & Cudeck,
1993).
Distribution of Social Isolation
We assess the distributions of social disconnectedness
and perceived isolation by comparing mean scale scores
across age, gender, and self-rated health among NSHAP re-
spondents. Because previous research has been inconclu-
sive regarding whether social isolation increases with age,
differences in the social isolation scales according to age
will be of particular interest.
Results
The Social Disconnectedness Scale
We propose that social disconnectedness can be assessed
using items capturing two central factors: a lack of social
network robustness and a lack of participation in social ac-
tivities. Based on their content validity, we initially identi-
fied 13 items for inclusion in the social disconnectedness
scale. The internal consistency of the scale was maximized
by removing five items: neighborhood socializing, fre-
quency of attendance at religious services, living alone/
household size, partnership status, number of children, and
number of grandchildren. Eight variables were retained.
Detailed information on their measurement is presented in
Table 1.
We include in the social disconnectedness scale four
measures from the NSHAP social network module, which
was based on the General Social Survey and described in
Cornwell, Laumann, Schumm, and Graber (in press). Social
network characteristics such as size, range, frequency of in-
teraction, and geographical proximity of network members
have been used in previous research to describe the collection
of people with whom a given individual interacts and may
rely on for social support (Haines & Hurlbert, 1992; Lin et al.,
1999). Network measures also, therefore, can be used to reveal
relative deficiencies in one's social connectedness. A small
or nonexistent network, a network that is geographically
MEASURING SOCIAL ISOLATION AMONG OLDER ADULTS i41
dispersed, or infrequent interaction with one's network
members, for example, may each indicate some level of
physical separation from others.
Social network size indicates the number of individuals
with whom the respondent can discuss important matters.
Social network range captures the extent to which a respon-
dent's network comprises different types of relationships.
Those who have greater network range are less apt to be
socially isolated because they have a larger variety of indi-
viduals (e.g., a spouse, family member, friend, coworker)
with whom they can interact. The proportion of social net-
work members who live in the household provides a rough
estimate of the physical proximity of one's network mem-
bers. Individuals who have a smaller proportion of their net-
work members residing with them have fewer opportunities
for interaction and may experience more objective isolation
than those who reside with a larger proportion of their net-
work members. Finally, frequency of contact with network
members indicates an individual's exposure to his network
members.
We also incorporate an indicator of the respondent's num-
ber of friends. Respondents indicated how many people they
considered to be their "closest friends" and those who were
"pretty good friends," excluding spouses and family mem-
bers. This provides another assessment of the social connec-
tions available to individuals, in addition to the network roster.
The number of friends provides a rough indicator of social
connectedness with others, regardless of the respondent's
ability and/or willingness to discuss "important matters" with
these people. This question was modularized so that a ran-
dom two thirds of respondents answered the question during
the in-person interview and one third responded to the ques-
tion on the leave-behind questionnaire. Mean response does
not differ according to the collection mode.
We initially included several other variables generally as-
sessing the extent of the respondent's universe of friends and
family members and his or her contact with them. First, liv-
ing alone is one of the most widely used indicators of social
isolation, and it typically indicates some degree of physical
separation from others. We tested both a dummy variable

indicating whether the respondent lived alone and a measure
of household size, but the item-rest correlations for both
variables were below .20, and the inclusion of either variable
decreased the shared variance among the scale items. Our
finding that living alone or having a small household do not
contribute to objective isolation, as measured here, supports
previous findings that living arrangements are not necessar-
ily indicative of social isolation (Waite & Hughes, 1999).
We also began with several variables that provide counts
of the respondent's family members, since being single and
having fewer children and grandchildren may be associated
with social disconnectedness among older adults. We ini-
tially included in the social disconnectedness scale a dummy
variable indicating partnership status and counts of the re-
spondent's number of children and number of grandchil-
dren. However, these items were removed from the scale
because their item-total correlations were below .30 and
their exclusion increased the overall internal consistency
reliability of the scale.
Participation in social activities such as organized group
involvement, volunteering, and attendance at religious ser-
vices has been used by previous research as indicators of
social connectedness (Ellison & George, 1994; McIntosh,
Sykes, & Kubena, 2002). We selected several items indicat-
ing participation in social groups or activities for inclusion
in the social disconnectedness scale. NSHAP respondents
were asked about their frequency of volunteer work, attend-
ing meetings of an organized group, and getting together
socially with friends or relatives. We also initially included
assessments of the frequency of socializing with neighbors
and attending religious services but removed these items to
improve the internal consistency reliability of the scale.
The resulting social disconnectedness scale includes the
eight items shown in Table 2. These items were standard-
ized and averaged to create the scale, and then the scores
were reversed because the variables initially measured con-
nectedness rather than isolation. Scores on the social dis-
connectedness scale range from -1.30 to 2.34, with a
weighted M of -0.02 and SD of 0.63. Social disconnected-
ness scores above zero are indicative of greater-than-average
disconnectedness, whereas scores below zero suggest lower-
than-average disconnectedness. In general, higher scores
indicate greater isolation.
Scale reliability.--This combination of the eight items
retained in the scale maximized the internal consistency re-
liability with a Cronbach's alpha of .73, and all item-rest
correlations were moderate to strong. The Social discon-
nectedness scale has acceptable reliability across age groups
and gender, as shown in Table 2. Item-rest correlations for
the scale are also remarkably similar across these subgroups,
and nearly all of them are at least moderate in strength. The
only exception is the variable indicating (a lack of) social-
izing with family and friends, for which the item-rest cor-
relation falls to .27 among men.
Confirmatory factor analysis.--Results from a confirmato-
ry factor analysis indicate that the data support a two-factor
structure, with dimensions similar to those we described ear-
lier. The four network items load on a restricted social network
dimension, and the three social participation variables load on
a social inactivity dimension. One surprise was that the lack of
friends is more reflective of social inactivity than a restricted
social network. This indicator has a standardized loading of
0.58 on the inactivity dimension. Each of the items has moder-
ate to strong loadings on the corresponding dimension. The
correlation between the restricted network dimension and the
inactivity dimension is moderate in strength, at .43.
Fit statistics generally indicate a good fit of the model to
the data. The c2 statistic is significant (c2 =35.14, p<.001),
indicating that we cannot reject the null hypothesis that the
model does not fit the data. However, this statistic is likely
inflated by the large sample size (Joreskog, 1969). The com-
parative fit index of 1.00 is well above the threshold of 0.90
for indication of a good fit compared with the baseline mode
(Diamantopoulos & Sigaw, 2000). The RMSEA of 0.035
indicates that the model is a close fit to the data because it is
lower than the typical cutoff of 0.05 (Browne & Cudeck,
1993).
The Perceived Isolation Scale
We also constructed a scale of subjective, or perceived,
isolation. Based on their content validity, we began scale
construction with 10 items from the NSHAP data indicating
one's perception of the supportiveness, closeness, adequacy,
and companionship provided by one's social relationships.
We retained nine items, which fall into two general catego-
ries: a perceived lack of support and loneliness. Descrip-
tions of these items are presented in Table 1.
Six of the nine items in the perceived isolation scale cap-
ture the respondent's assessment of social support available
from family, friends, and one's spouse or current partner.
These questions are drawn from the 2002 Health and Re-
tirement Study. Respondents were asked how often they can
open up to their spouse or current partner, family members,
and friends and how often they can rely on people from
these three groups. The perception that one can rarely ac-
cess emotional and instrumental support from friends and
family may contribute to perceived isolation.
Because loneliness is based on the perception of having
fewer (or less close) interpersonal relationships than one would
like (van Baarsen et al., 2001), we consider it here as a facet of
subjective social isolation. We incorporate responses to the
three-item loneliness scale developed by Hughes and col-
leagues (2004) and examined in Shiovitz-Ezra, Leitsch, Graber,
and Karraker (in press). The loneliness scale includes items
assessing the respondent's perceived lack of companionship
and frequency of feeling left out and isolated (Hughes et al.).
We also examined the possibility of including a variable
assessing average emotional closeness with one's network
MEASURING SOCIAL ISOLATION AMONG OLDER ADULTS i43
members. We expected that low emotional closeness with
network members would indicate perceived isolation. How-
ever, this item had a low item-rest correlation (.22) and its
removal increased the scale's overall internal consistency
(although the improvement was marginal, from .69 to .70).
We therefore removed this item from the scale. Most re-
spondents indicated that their relationships with network
members were quite close, so a lack of cases at the low end
of this variable may have reduced its fit with the scale. More
importantly, the item's lack of fit with the scale indicates
that the quality of one's relationships may be conceptually
distinct from the perception of isolation.
Table 2 lists the nine items retained in the perceived iso-
lation scale. The items were standardized and their values
were averaged to arrive at a score for perceived isolation.
The scale ranges from -0.98 to 3.63, with a weighted M of
-0.01 and SD of 0.59. Higher scores indicate greater per-
ceived isolation.
Scale reliability--The resulting scale has a Cronbach's
alpha of .70, indicating acceptable internal consistency.
Each of the item-rest correlations exceeds the cutoff of .20
for satisfactory reliability (Kline, 1986). With the exception
of the item assessing one's ability to open up to his or her
friends, all the item-rest correlations are above .30. The
scale also demonstrates acceptable reliability across age
groups and gender, as shown in Table 2. Although the Cron-
bach's alpha coefficients drop slightly below .70 for the
middle-old and oldest-old age groups, as well as for males,
the differences across subgroups are small. Item-rest corre-
lations across the age and gender subgroups range from .23
to .30, with the vast majority of these correlations being
above .30.
Confirmatory factor analysis--Results from a confirma-
tory factor analysis indicate that six items assessing
social support load on a perceived lack of support dimen-
sion, and the three items from the short loneliness scale load
on a loneliness dimension. Standardized loadings exceed
0.60, with the exception of the item regarding reliance on
one's spouse, which has a standardized loading of 0.32 on
the perceived lack of support dimension. The correlation
between the perceived lack of support dimension and the
loneliness dimension (.19) is weak to moderate in strength.
Fit statistics generally indicate an acceptable fit of the
model to the data. The c2 statistic is significant (c2 =52.60,
p<.001), indicating that we cannot reject the null hypothe-
sis that the model does not fit the data. This statistic should
be used with caution, however, because it is likely inflated
by the large sample size (Joreskog, 1969). Both the
comparative fit index (0.99) and the RMSEA (0.040) ex-
ceed conventional thresholds (Browne & Cudeck, 1993;
Diamantopoulos & Sigaw, 2000), thereby indicating that
the model has an acceptably close fit to the data.
Social Disconnectedness and Perceived Isolation Among
Older Adults
Most previous research has found only a modest correlation
between aspects of disconnectedness and perceived isolation

and perceived isolation scales are positively correlated,
but the correlation is weak to moderate in strength (r=.25,
p<.001). Individuals who lack social connections are more
likely to feel isolated. However, some people who have many
social connections still feel lonely, whereas others who have
very few social connections do not feel lonely at all.
What is the distribution of the experience and perception
of social isolation within a population-based sample of
older adults? We provide a brief examination of this by con-
sidering mean scores for the social disconnectedness and
perceived isolation scales across age, gender, and self-rated
health of the older adults in our sample.
Previous research indicates that loneliness increases with
age (Dykstra et al., 2005) and social connectedness may de-
cline with age (McPherson et al., 2006), although other
work has suggested that older adults may adjust their social
networks and expectations so that they are no more isolated
or lonely than their younger counterparts (Lang &
Carstensen, 1994; Schnittker, 2007). As shown in Table 3,
we find very little difference in social disconnectedness
across age groups. The oldest old do not have fewer connec-
tions than the younger old, on average, but the perception of
isolation does increase with age. The oldest old have sig-
nificantly higher scores for perceived isolation than the
youngest old (p<.01).
With respect to gender, previous research suggests that
social network size does not significantly differ for men and
women (McPherson et al., 2006). However, women are
more likely to participate in social activities and voluntary
associations (Sherkat & Ellison, 1999; Wilson, 2000), and
they tend to experience less loneliness than men (Borys &
Perlman, 1985). But this previous work has not focused
specifically on late adulthood, when widowhood, retire-
ment, health changes, and other factors may shift individu-
als' opportunities for social engagement (Ferraro, 1984; Li
& Ferraro, 2005). As indicated in Table 3, we find that
women have significantly lower scores for both social dis-
connectedness and perceived isolation (p<.001), on aver-
age. Older women, therefore, are less likely than men to
suffer social disconnectedness or perceived isolation than
older men.
Finally, nearly all the indicators of isolation that we have
combined in these two scales have associated with worse
health in previous research (see, e.g., Berkman, 1995;
Cacioppo & Hawkley, 2003; House, 2001; House et al.,
1988). We therefore expect that both social disconnected-
ness and perceived isolation will be negatively related to
self-rated health. Indeed, we find higher levels of social dis-
connectedness and perceived isolation among older adults
who have worse health. More specifically, older adults who
rated their health as "very good" or "excellent" had below
average levels of both social disconnectedness and perceived
isolation. But those who have "good," "fair," or "poor"
health also have significantly greater scores on the social
isolation scales. The gradient observed here--where both
social disconnectedness and perceived isolation increase as
self-rated health decreases--suggests a broad relationship
between social isolation and health. Further research is
needed to elucidate the causal order in the relationships
between health and various aspects of social isolation and to
assess the relative effects of social disconnectedness and
perceived isolation on particular health outcomes.
Discussion
By combining multiple indicators of social isolation col-
lected in the NSHAP study, we have developed two reliable
scales assessing social disconnectedness and perceived iso-
lation. Our results indicate that these two dimensions of iso-
lation are related but distinct. Individuals who have small
social networks or rarely participate in social activities do
not necessarily feel lonely. Furthermore, one may be sur-
rounded by friends and family but perceive a lack of social
support and feel left out.

MEASURING SOCIAL ISOLATION AMONG OLDER ADULTS i45
Because so many different aspects of social isolation have
been separately examined in previous research, this work
has been inconclusive regarding whether social isolation in-
creases with age. Our findings show that social disconnect-
edness is not more marked among the oldest old compared
with the young old. However, the oldest old are more likely
to perceive themselves as isolated than the young old. Fur-
ther research is needed to understand the source of the
greater feelings of loneliness and the perceived lack of so-
cial support that are more common among oldest adults.
The creation of scales measuring social disconnectedness
and perceived isolation provides one way to use the wide
variety of indicators of social isolation collected in the
NSHAP study. These scales also recognize an important fact
about the complexity of individuals' everyday social lives:
No single indicator of perceived or actual social isolation can
fully assess the degree to which an individual lacks social
resources or outlets for socializing, feels that emotional and
material support are unavailable in times of need, or yearns
for companionship. Further research is needed to assess the
validity of these scales and refine the measurement of social
disconnectedness and perceived isolation. At the most basic
level, we argue that the combination of multiple measures is
imperative for the assessment of social isolation.
The social disconnectedness and perceived isolation
scales available in the NSHAP data bring a number of ben-
efits for future research. First, because the scales are con-
tinuous variables, they enable analysis of the functional
form of the relationship between disconnectedness and per-
ceived isolation and specific health outcomes. We can as-
sess, for example, whether social isolation exerts a gradual
or threshold effect on health. The scales also allow research-
ers to take into account a number of aspects of isolation
using a parsimonious indicator, which is especially useful
for inclusion in multivariate analyses predicting health out-
comes. Most importantly, the scales will enable comparison
of the specific health risks brought by a lack of social con-
nections versus perceived isolation. We hope that these
analyses will move us closer to understanding the mecha-
nisms through which each form of isolation may threaten
health and well-being among the growing population of
community-residing older adults.
