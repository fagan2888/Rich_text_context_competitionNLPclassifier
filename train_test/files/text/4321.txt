Jealousy has been explored by social scientists primarily within
the context of adult romantic relationships where its defining
feature is the triangle of relations among an individual, her
beloved, and an interloper who is a potential threat to the indi-
vidual's relationship with the beloved (Mathes, 1991; Parrott,
1991). In response to such threat, an individual can express jeal-
ousy via different emotions, such as anger, sadness, and fear,
that can be combined in several ways (Izard, 1991; Plutchik,
1980). They can be felt in combination as a blended emotion, or
separately but in succession with changes in an individual's
cognitive appraisal of the eliciting condition or deployment of
different coping mechanisms (Hupka, 1984; Sharpsteen, 1991).
Alternatively, these emotions have been viewed as being driven
by a foundational and irreducible affective experience that is
unique to jealousy (Harris, 2003; Harris & Darby, 2010).
Drawing on a functionalist perspective, wherein jealousy is
regarded as serving to motivate behaviors that protect the indi-
vidual­beloved relationship, Harris points out that in and of
themselves, emotions, such as anger, sadness, and fear, are not
known to be responsible for a motivational state of this nature.
Jealousy has also been addressed in the developmental litera-
ture. Interest in it as an early-emerging phenomenon arose from
anecdotal accounts as well as several experimental studies in
which a young child witnessed her parent directing positive
attention preferentially toward a third party. Cummings and
associates (Cummings, Zahn-Waxler, & Radke-Yarrow, 1981)
found that when observing their parents express anger toward
each other, children responded with matching displays of angry
behavior. Interestingly, however, the children also demonstrated
angry behavior when their parents showed each other affection.
In laboratory research designed specifically to induce jealousy,
Teti and Ablard (1989) found that when mothers directed atten-
tion exclusively toward one child, the child's sibling exhibited
restorative bids marked by attention-seeking behaviors, as well
as protests manifested by fussing, crying, and aggression.
Parallel patterns, characterized by protest and protection, as
well as coping behaviors, were observed in young children in
similarly designed studies where parental attention was directed
preferentially toward a sibling (Miller, Volling, & McElwain,
2000; Volling, McElwain, & Miller, 2002), a peer (Bauminger,
Chomsky-Smolkin, Orbach-Caspi, Zachor, & Levy-Shiff,
2008), and a lifelike baby doll (Hart & Harris, 2014; Szabo,
Dubas, & van Aken, 2014).
In each of these studies, the term jealousy or rivalry was
used to label children's negative responses to differential treat-
ment. Since several studies included infants under 18 months of
age (Miller et al., 2000; Szabo et al., 2014; Volling et al., 2002),
with some including infants as young as 13 (Teti & Ablard,
1989) and 10 months (Cummings et al., 1981), a number of
investigators have entertained the possibility that a nascent form

Abstract
In this synthesis, we summarize studies that yielded evidence of jealousy in young infants. To shed light on this phenomenon,
we present evidence that jealousy's foundation rests on history of dyadic interactions with caregivers which engender infants'
expectations of exclusivity, and on maturation of sociocognitive capacities that enable infants to evaluate whether an exchange
between their caregiver and another child represents a violation of that expectation. We conclude with a call for greater study of
the antecedents and sequelae of both normative and atypical presentations of jealousy. In addition, we recommend approaches
that address jealousy across a range of relationships, both within and beyond those which include attachment figures.

of jealousy could be documented in young infants. The present
article summarizes the body of research in this area. As in work
on jealousy or rivalry in children, we operationally define jeal-
ousy in infants as negatively-valenced responses precipitated by
differential treatment wherein a beloved individual, such as a
caregiver, directs attention preferentially toward a third party.
We will then address some of the contextual and intraindividual
foundations of jealousy's early emergence, and offer sugges-
tions for future research. Through this treatment we hope to
advance understanding of jealousy in its nascent form.
Evidence of Jealousy in Young Infants
In studies using infants as young as 4 and 5 months (Draghi-
Lorenz, Reddy, & Costall, 2001; Masciuch & Kienapple, 1993),
jealousy was explored by comparing a target infant's responses
while maternal attention was directed toward a stimulus infant
versus an adult, a child, or a nonsocial object. Both studies
reported greater deterioration in the target infant's mood when
the stimulus was an infant, but only one (Draghi-Lorenz et al.,
2001) attributed it to jealousy.The other (Masciuch & Kienapple,
1993) mentioned that it was difficult to attribute the target
infant's deteriorated mood to the experimental manipulation
due to confounds stemming from spontaneous fussiness in the
stimulus infant. To help control for such limitations, several
studies have used a lifelike baby doll instead of a real infant
(Voorthuis et al., 2013). To induce jealousy, the baby doll has
been wrapped in a receiving blanket and equipped with audio
recordings of a real infant emitting utterances, such as "ma-ma."
Research that compared infants' responses while mother's posi-
tive vocal affect was directed toward a lifelike baby doll versus
a story book reported that infants displayed greater negativity
when the object of maternal attention was a baby doll (Hart &
Carrington, 2002; Hart, Field, Del Valle, & Letourneau, 1998;
Mize & Jones, 2012; Mize, Pineda, Blau, & Jones, 2014).
Studies that detailed infants' responses during the mother­
baby doll condition explored infants' facial affect, behavioral,
and neurological responses. Inquiry into facial affect revealed
that 6- and 13-month-olds expressed sadness (Hart, Carrington,
Tronick, & Carroll, 2004; Mize & Jones, 2012), which is con-
sistent with findings on 23-month-olds whose presentations of
jealousy were also characterized by this particular expression
(Szabo et al., 2014). Work with 6-month-olds found that jeal-
ousy was also associated with facial affect expressions of inter-
est (Hart et al., 2004). In studies with adults, this affect has been
construed as an index of desire or love, an inherent ingredient of
jealousy (Hendrick & Hendrick, 2003; Lee, 1988), and it was
interpreted similarly with regard to infants (Hart, 2015).
Attention to behavioral components revealed that mother-
directed approach responses were the most predictable responses
to differential treatment in nonmobile 6- and 9-month-olds
(Hart et al., 2004; Mize et al., 2014), and were exceptionally
pronounced in mobile 10- to 13-month-olds (Hart & Behrens,
2013a; Hart, Field, Del Valle, et al., 1998; Mize & Jones, 2012).
These actions were manifested through assertive restorative
bids for contact, and through protests, some marked by aggres-
sion, that expressed anger. Anger was also conveyed through
findings using EEG. Inquiry into neural substrates of 9-month-
olds' responses to differential treatment found that these were
characterized by relative left frontal EEG activation (Mize
et al., 2014). This pattern of neural activity has been associated
with approach emotions, including anger in infants (Fox, 1991;
He et al., 2010), and jealousy in adults (Harmon-Jones, Peterson,
& Harris, 2009).
Inquiry into behavioral components of response also yielded
evidence of regulatory responses. When their mothers' exclu-
sive attention was restored following differential treatment,
10-month-olds were challenged by the task of establishing
interactive repair. Recovery was superior among infants who
had demonstrated lower durations of mother-directed gaze dur-
ing the eliciting condition (Hart & Behrens, 2013b). Since
averted gaze has been recognized as an emotion regulation strat-
egy in studies on infants' responses in stressful settings (K. A.
Buss & Goldsmith, 1998; Stifter & Braungart, 1995), and since
regulatory responses have been implicated in jealousy responses
of both children and adults (Volling et al., 2002), visual inatten-
tion was interpreted as a regulatory strategy in the present con-
text as well.
In addition to these findings on facial affect, behavioral, and
neurological responses, inquiry into jealousy's presentation
yielded several noteworthy response patterns. First, infants'
facial affect expressions of sadness were found associated with
approach behaviors indicative of anger (Hart et al., 2004). Even
though these two kinds of response are known to co-occur, they
usually do so in succession, in what is sometimes described as a
display of ambivalence. The field of infancy research rarely
reports on these two responses occurring as a simultaneous
event. Instead, sad facial affect is typically seen in combination
with avoidant behaviors (Cohn & Tronick, 1983; Mesman, van
IJzendoorn, & Bakermans-Kranenburg, 2009), while angry
facial affect tends to coincide with approach behaviors (Lewis,
Alessandri, & Sullivan, 1990; Lewis & Ramsay, 2005). Thus, it
appears that the infant's affective-behavioral response to differ-
ential treatment is phenotypically unique, and tied specifically
to jealousy.
By entailing components of response that are associated with
both sadness and anger, jealousy's presentation in infants sug-
gests a mixture of emotions (Fogel, 2011; Hart, 2015). This
depiction is compatible with notions of jealousy in adults as a
blended emotion (Pfeiffer & Wong, 1989; Sharpsteen, 1991).
Still, this does not rule out the possibility that these observable
expressions of emotionality are driven by a more foundational
temperamentally based sensitivity (Hart 2010a, 2010b, 2015;
Hart & Carrington, 2002) or an underlying emotion that is
unique to jealousy (Harris, 2003; Harris & Darby, 2010). Such
an emotion is conceptualized as motivated specifically by per-
ceived threat to a valued relationship and operates by stimulat-
ing emotions that work in conjunction toward the goal of
restoring or maintaining the relationship being challenged
(Harris, 2003; Harris & Darby, 2010).
Interestingly, the prominence of infants'restorative bids sup-
ports Bowlby's observation that, "in most young children the
360 Emotion Review Vol. 8 No. 4
mere sight of mother holding another baby in her arms is enough
to elicit strong attachment behavior" (1969/1983, p. 260).
Implicit in this comment is Bowlby's understanding that as an
expression of attachment behavior, jealousy is triggered by
sense of threat, which coheres with understanding of jealousy in
children and adults as a response to endangerment (Parrott,
1991; Teti & Ablard, 1989; Volling et al., 2002).
The combination of sadness and anger is also notable for its
potential to prompt behavior in both infants and caregivers
(Hart, 2015). While an infant's expression of sadness serves as
a signal that engenders caregivers' nurturance (K. A. Buss &
Kiel, 2004; Eisenberg et al., 1989; Horstmann, 2003; Shipman,
Zeman, Nesin, & Fitzgerald, 2003), anger mobilizes actions that
are instrumental toward achieving a goal (Frijda, 2008; Lewis
et al., 1990). In the context of differential treatment, an infant's
sad facial affect may serve to reenlist caregiver attention, while
anger may prompt a rival to withdraw. Indeed, some evidence
suggests that jealousy acts as a signal that observers find com-
pelling (Hart, 2010c).
A second unique pattern of linkages emerged from findings
that infants' sad facial expressions differed with the degree to
which their mothers' vocal affect toward the baby doll was pos-
itively valenced (Hart, 2010a; Hart, Field, Del Valle, et al.,
1998). When mothers displayed greater positivity, their infants
demonstrated greater negativity. This association is exactly
opposite that which would have been expected had the mothers
been smiling toward something other than an infant (Termine &
Izard, 1988; Tronick, Cohn, & Shea, 1986). It is also in line with
Cummings and associates' (1981) discovery that when witness-
ing their parents display affection toward each other, children
did not display a matching pattern of positive emotionality or
affection. To the contrary, they expressed anger.
A third pattern of linkages emerged from treatments that
manipulated the identity of the adult demonstrating differential
treatment. When 12-month-olds were ignored while an adult's
attention was directed exclusively toward a book, their responses
did not depend on whether the adult was their mother or a stran-
ger. However, when the object of adult attention was a lifelike
baby doll, infants displayed greater protest if the adult was their
mother (Hart, Field, Del Valle, et al., 1998). This finding is con-
sistent with similar research using preschoolers (Bauminger-
Zvieli & Kugelmass, 2013). It is also compatible with evidence
that adults who reported greater distress upon seeing their part-
ner flirt with a third party also reported feeling more dependent
on that partner (Rydell & Bringle, 2007), and understanding of
jealousy as a feature of love relationships (D. M. Buss, 2000).
In sum, differential treatment elicits responses in infants
marked by facial affect of sadness and interest, mother-directed
restorative bids for contact and attention, protests and neuro-
logical responses that are consistent with anger, and the deploy-
ment of regulatory strategies. Since maternal inattentiveness
was held constant across conditions, it seems unlikely that
infants were perturbed simply due to being ignored, and so
enthusiasm for interpretations other than jealousy is limited.
Further support for this conclusion can be drawn from findings
on the manner in which these perturbations were exhibited.
These unveiled phenotypic characteristics and patterns of
response parallel to those which are widely accepted as indica-
tive of jealousy in both children and adults. These also appear to
be both unique to differential treatment and conceptually aligned
with understanding of jealousy as a response to threat.
This interpretation of jealousy is not offered without some
caveats. Granted, confidence in this interpretation would be
greater were it possible to point to a particular facial affect
expression that is unique to jealousy. Unfortunately, such an
expression is unknown to scientists working with adults or chil-
dren (Bryson, 1991; Sabini & Silver, 2005). So, like workers in
those areas, infancy researchers have sought a basis other than
simple reliance on facial affect to infer jealousy. This of course
is the uniqueness of the eliciting context. Tapping into this
methodology yields negatively valenced emotionality in infants
that has consistently been interpreted as jealousy by the investi-
gators, while few, if any, alternative interpretations have been
put forth.
Proximal Foundations
Evidence of jealousy in young infants raises questions with
respect to mechanisms responsible for its unfolding. Two kinds
of factors may be especially relevant. The first pertains to con-
textual influences; the second to maturational processes that
relate to sociocognitive development.
Contextual Influences
Jealousy in children has primarily been regarded as arising
within contexts marked by competition with a rival for a car-
egiver's attention. In different eras, the nature of the rival has
differed considerably. In classic writings, the rival was a parent
(S. Freud, 1923). Later on, attention turned to peers (Bridges,
1932; A. Freud & Dann, 1947; Gesell, 1906). By the mid-1900s,
with the rise in nuclear family structures and a number of alarm-
ing accounts by prominent clinicians (Adler, 1959; Levy, 1934),
attention turned to contexts where the rival was a sibling. At this
point, child responses that had previously been referred to as
jealousy and had generally been regarded as benign, came to be
reframed as "rivalry" and interpreted as a sign of maladjustment
(Clanton & Kosins, 1991; Stearns, 2010). Following this tradi-
tion, laboratory research in this area began by using triads com-
prised of a parent and a pair of siblings, with the aim of eliciting
rivalry, and the prediction that rivalry would be amplified among
children who were insecurely attached (Teti & Ablard, 1989).
As expected, such efforts were successful. Interestingly,
however, recent studies using young infants found that a par-
ent's differential attention toward a third party is disturbing to
infants, even those who do not have a sibling. In fact, there are
few differences between presentations of jealousy in infants
who are firstborn versus those who have siblings (Hart, Field,
Del Valle, et al., 1998; Hart & Behrens, 2013b). This is interest-
ing for it suggests that a history of exposure to eliciting condi-
tions, such as differential treatment and triadic conflict, which
to some degree are inevitable for infants who have a sibling, is
Hart Infant Jealousy 361
not a necessary precondition for the onset of jealousy. This
notion is compatible with evidence that jealousy in adults does
not depend on whether an individual has a sibling (Bringle &
Williams, 1979; Clanton & Kosins, 1991). Given that jealousy's
onset is not dependent on history of exposure to a sibling, other
kinds of influences must be considered.
Anumber of studies asked whether jealousy's presentation in
young infants depends on contextual events that pertain to char-
acteristics of mothers and the mother­infant relationship (Hart,
2010a; Hart & Behrens, 2013a, 2013b; Hart, Field, Letourneau,
& Del Valle, 1998; Hart et al., 2004; Hart, Jones, & Field, 2003).
In line with evidence that young siblings' presentations of jeal-
ousy were more acute among children who were insecurely
attached (Teti & Ablard, 1989), jealousy in infants was found
heightened among those with insecure-resistant attachment.
Acute responses were also demonstrated by infants whose
mothers displayed hostile or insensitive interactive behaviors.
In contrast, jealousy was found blunted among infants with
insecure-avoidant attachment and among infants of depressed
mothers. Deleterious effects of maternal depression were com-
pounded by parenting styles marked by disengagement. In addi-
tion to prompting presentations of jealousy that were
exceptionally flat, this amalgam of risk factors was associated
with infants directing restorative bids toward a stranger rather
than mother, which is a well-recognized sign of emotional dys-
regulation in infants and young children.
These findings highlight divergent pathways of development
as having roots in dyadic experiences with caregivers. They also
yielded four profiles of jealousy's development: inhibited, dis-
inhibited, dysregulated, and organized (Hart, 2015). The latter
profile, organized, is characterized by mild levels of negative
emotionality, moderate durations of mother-directed restorative
bids, and emotion regulation skills that enable the infant to
smoothly resume contact with mother once her exclusive atten-
tion has been restored. This characterization is remarkable for
offering an empirically based definition of jealousy's normative
form, not only in the statistical sense but also on the basis of
associations with protective influences (Cicchetti, 2006). It is
also relevant to understanding that infant jealousy's valence,
even in its typical form (as displayed by the securely attached
infant of a nondepressed, sensitive mother), is negative.
Unfortunately, this reality, coupled with the fact that jealousy is
elicited in triadic contexts, has led to some longstanding mis-
conceptions. The chief one is that jealousy originates due to his-
tory of negatively valenced triadic conflict, and in its absence
jealousy does not unfold.
To the contrary, linkages with characteristics of mothers
(rather than sibling status), and with protective influences
(rather than conflict), remind us that emotional development
occurs through a process in which events that are responsible
for the onset of an emotion are not the same as those responsible
for eliciting that emotion once it has already been set in place.
More simply, "when affects emerge" and "how they emerge" are
separate processes (Sroufe, 1995, p. 4). Thus, we have sug-
gested that understanding how jealousy emerges calls upon
insight into history of dyadic, not triadic, interactions, and
understanding that in its normative form, jealousy is born, not of
conflict, but of positive experiences. These experiences consist
of exchanges with a beloved individual, such as a caregiver,
through which an infant comes to prize and expect exclusive
access to that individual (Hart, 2010a, 2015; Hart, Field, Del
Valle, et al., 1998).
Sociocognitive Foundations
The end of the infant's first year is marked by important mile-
stones including advances in cognition that relate to socioemo-
tional and cognitive development. These are regarded as being
of enormous magnitude, such that they are responsible for pre-
cipitating a "psychological revolution" (Anderson et al., 2013).
Nevertheless, jealousy has been construed as a complex emo-
tion, classified among "sophisticated" affects such as embar-
rassment, guilt, pride, shame, resentment, and exasperation
(Fischer, Shaver, & Carnochan, 1989). This class of emotions is
seen as unavailable to infants less than 18 months of age (Case,
Hayward, Lewis, & Hurst, 1988; Lewis, Sullivan, Stanger, &
Weiss, 1989) due to requiring advanced cognitive processes that
have "at their heart, the notion of self, agency, and conscious
intentions" (Lewis, 2003, p. 286).
The notion that jealousy is beyond the ability of 1-year-olds
has been influential. It has rested on eloquent theorizing, yet the
empirical basis has been limited. A frequently cited source of
support is Lewis and associates' (1989) report on the contribu-
tion of self-awareness to the development of complex emotions.
They found that a toddler's ability to express the complex emo-
tion of embarrassment, but not the basic emotion of wariness,
coincided with her ability to display evidence of self-recogni-
tion. This finding led to the conclusion that the capacity to
express embarrassment depends on the prior acquisition of self-
awareness, which also served as the basis for assuming that this
conclusion applied to all other complex emotions, including
jealousy. However, the importance of self-recognition to jeal-
ousy's presentation has never been tested. A second study of
importance was research on child responses to differential treat-
ment as a function of child age (Masciuch & Kienapple, 1993).
Its conclusion that jealousy was not apparent in infants under 18
months of age (Case et al., 1988) has been questioned since dis-
turbances were also displayed by younger infants but discounted
by the investigators in a manner that has been deemed arbitrary
(Draghi-Lorenz et al., 2001). Nor has it been replicated.
Interestingly, the report of jealousy in children who witnessed
their parents treat each other with affection (Cummings et al.,
1981) included children ranging in age from 10 months to 2 and
a half years, and it did not mention any differences as a function
of child age.
Limited empirical support for viewing jealousy as a complex
emotion has led to growing openness to the possibility that there
may be levels of interpersonal awareness that are not essential
to jealousy in its nascent form (Hobson, 2010, 2012). Such
openness has been spurred further by evidence that jealousy is
exhibited by autistic children despite their deficiencies with
respect to a host of complex emotions, such as pride and guilt
362 Emotion Review Vol. 8 No. 4
(Bauminger et al., 2008; Bauminger-Zvieli & Kugelmass, 2013;
Hobson, 2010). It has also been documented in nonhuman spe-
cies even though they lack sense of self (Harris & Prouvost,
2014; Morris, Doe, & Godsell, 2008). Thus, it has been sug-
gested that jealousy may be more "prepared" than other com-
plex emotions, and so it requires minimal cognition (Panksepp,
2010). Along these lines, Campos and associates (Campos,
Walle, & Dahl, 2010) suggested that as a phenomenon which
taps basic emotions, it is possible that jealousy emerges late in
the first year, subsequent to the development of basic emotions,
yet prior to the emergence of complex emotions.
These suggestions may be pursued by considering that at its
most basic level, jealousy entails that an individual has an emo-
tional response to a relation between two other individuals
(Hobson, 2010). This conceptualization calls for efforts to
unveil evidence of the young infant's capacity to interpret this
very context. At least two bodies of research have been forth-
coming.
The first arose from research on couples' transitions to par-
enthood upon the birth of a firstborn child (Cowan & Cowan,
1988; Fivaz-Depeursinge & Corboz-Warnery, 1999; Fivaz-
Depeursinge, Favez, Scaiola, & Lopes, 2010). When research-
ers observed infants interacting within triadic social contexts
that included both mother and father, they found that infants
were not mere observers. Nor were they limited to interacting
with only one social partner at a time. Rather, they played an
active role in triadic social exchanges by displaying rapid transi-
tions in visual attention, from one social partner to the other, as
if tracking an ongoing exchange. They also displayed valence-
matching of affect across social partners, suggesting the ability
to communicate affect with two partners simultaneously.
Triangular bids of this nature have been observed in infants as
young as 3 months (Philipp, Fivaz-Depeursinge, Corboz-
Warnery, & Favez, 2009; Tremblay & Rovira, 2007), consid-
ered well-established by the age of 6 to 9 months (McHale,
Fivaz-Depeursinge, Dickstein, Robertson, & Daley, 2008), and
documented across different kinds of triadic social settings
(Bradley, 2010; Selby & Bradley, 2003). Contrary to traditional
understanding of interaction skill as undergoing a progression
that starts with understanding person­person exchanges, and
progresses to comprehending person­object and then person­
person­object exchanges toward the end of the first year,
McHale and associates (2008) propose that the first year ends
with robust capacities for person­person­person interaction
capacities that originated early in the first year.
Evidence that infants are capable of responding to a relation
between other individuals also emerged from work on moral
cognition (Wynn & Bloom, 2014). When 6-month-olds were
given a choice between two characters, they opted for the one
they had seen acting in a helpful (versus unhelpful) manner
toward a third party (Hamlin, Wynn, & Bloom, 2007). Similar
findings were uncovered using infants as young as 3 months
(Hamlin, Wynn, & Bloom, 2010). By the age of 8 months,
infants demonstrated preferences for a helpful (versus unhelp-
ful) character even if that character's efforts to be helpful were
unsuccessful, suggesting the ability to understand and even
appreciate a character's intentions (Hamlin, 2013). Cognition of
this nature can drive emotionality. Cummings and associates
concluded that, "by approximately 1 year of age, children are
not only aware of other's angry and affectionate interactions but
are also quite likely to evidence an emotional reaction to them"
(Cummings et al., 1981, p. 1280).
Taken together, these findings reflect a level of cognitive
sophistication that speaks to the possibility that by the latter half
of the first year an infant is able to process exchanges such as
those between his mother and another infant. Moreover, it seems
feasible that when observing his mother treat another child with
affection, the infant is able to interpret that stimulus as posing
challenge to his expectation of being the sole recipient of his
mother's affection.
Future Directions
We have argued that jealousy's foundation rests on experiences
that foster expectations of exclusivity as well as cognitive pre-
requisites that enable an infant to evaluate whether an exchange
between his caregiver and another child represents a violation of
that expectation. This calls for deeper understanding of the out-
growth of such expectations.
One avenue toward such understanding draws on theory that
jealousy is necessary toward protecting access to a caregiver's
resources when these are challenged by another child (Hamilton,
1964; Trivers, 1974). This view is in line with opinion that,
when a child finds himself relatively neglected in favor of the new baby,
assertion of his claims may redress the balance. Thus in the right place,
at the right time, and in the right degree, anger is not only appropriate
but may be indispensable. (Bowlby, 1988, pp. 79­80)
These positions are relevant to interpreting restorative bids that
are an especially prominent feature of jealousy in infants.
Bothersome as they may be, their intractability may be grounded
in their importance toward protecting a relationship that is vital
to survival (Bjorklund & Pellegrini, 2002; Dillon, 2013).
This possibility can be addressed through attention to blunted
presentations of jealousy. As displayed by infants of depressed
mothers and infants with insecure-avoidant attachment, inhib-
ited presentations of jealousy seem consistent with reports of
passivity and expressionlessness being exhibited by such infants
in other stressful situations (Dix, Meunier, Lusk, & Perfect,
2012; Feng et al., 2008; Silk, Shaw, Skuban, Oland, & Kovacs,
2006). Attenuated emotionality has been found predictive of
diminished social competence (Maughan, Cicchetti, Toth, &
Rogosch, 2007), suggesting that adjustment difficulties upon a
sibling's arrival (Dunn, 1986) may be foreshadowed by jeal-
ousy's blunted expression during infancy.
Whether and how inhibited expressions of jealousy differ
from other atypical presentations is unclear. Campos and associ-
ates (2010) speculated that these may arise from protracted
exposure to differential treatment. In line with observations
(Bowlby, 1973) that prolonged exposure to separation from
mother leads children to pass through stages of protest, despair,
Hart Infant Jealousy 363
and finally detachment, Campos and associates proposed a sim-
ilar trajectory in which acute jealousy is an infant's initial
response to differential treatment. However, upon failing to
reclaim caregiver attention, it is followed eventually by a more
impaired state of resignation, marked by blunted affect. The
possibility that acute jealousy is a precursor of blunted jealousy
is an intriguing notion. Still, evidence that inhibited and disin-
hibited presentations of jealousy originate with different kinds
of risk factors suggests continuity along separate trajectories.
Ultimately, insight into pathways of jealousy's development
will require prospective longitudinal research on antecedents
and sequelae of both organized and atypical presentations of
jealousy.
Cross-sectional studies will also be informative, especially
those which explore jealousy across different relationships.
Evidence that differential treatment was more disturbing to
infants if it had been elicited by mother rather than a stranger
(Hart, Field, Letourneau, et al., 1998) coheres with understand-
ing that in its most intense form, jealousy in adults occurs within
love relationships. It is also consistent with the observation that
"there is strong bias for attachment behavior to become directed
mainly toward one particular person and for a child to become
strongly possessive of that person" (Bowlby, 1969/1983,
p. 308). Nevertheless, jealousy in adults is a feature of relation-
ships other than those which are romantic or sexual in nature (D.
M. Buss, 2000), and jealousy in children can occur among peers
(Parker, Kruse, & Aikins, 2010; Parker, Low, Walker, & Gamm,
2005). In a similar vein, jealousy in infants has been noted in
their relationships with caregivers other than mother, and with
noncaregivers, such as peers (Bradley, 2010; Bridges, 1932;
Darwin, 1877; A. Freud & Dann, 1947).
The possibility that jealousy in infants is not limited solely to
protecting the relationship with the primary caregiver calls for
inquiry into expectations of exclusivity as they arise across a
spectrum of relationships. These relationships may provide the
infant with caregiving, or hold potential to provide surrogate
caregiving, or offer entirely different sorts of desirable resources.
Based on numerous anecdotal accounts, comparisons of this
nature are likely to reveal that the infant who expects to be the
sole recipient of his mother's resources can, at the very same
time, also expect to be the sole recipient of his father's resources
and those of others as well. Consequently, it is plausible that
efforts along these lines will reveal that infants' expectations of
exclusivity tend to operate in a nonreciprocal, rather than bidi-
rectional, manner.
A relationship that may be especially informative is that
which includes twins (Fearon, Bakermans-Kranenburg, & van
IJzendoorn, 2010). A study that used pairs of 11- to 14-month-
old twins found that differential treatment prompted responses
much like those which had been reported in research where the
rival was not a twin (Gewirtz & Pelaez-Nogueras, 1999). The
fact that differential treatment appears to elicit jealousy in twins,
who most likely have lesser history of exclusive contact with a
caregiver, raises questions about the nature of dyadic interaction
that is sufficient for engendering expectations of exclusivity.
One possibility rests on observations that triadic social contexts
do not preclude opportunities for an infant to receive preferen-
tial treatment. This was illustrated in a qualitative study that
described how a caregiver of twins alternated the direction of
her attention between each infant individually (Draghi-Lorenz,
2010). Perhaps the degree of exclusivity that is inherent in pref-
erential treatment is sufficient for precipitating expectations that
can give rise to jealousy. This would help explain why jeal-
ousy's emergence does not depend on birth order (Hart, Field,
Del Valle, et al., 1998). Such speculation leads to suggesting
that expectations of exclusivity emerge through dyadic
exchanges, including those which take place within nonexclu-
sive settings in the sense that they are embedded within higher
order relationships. This calls for investigative attention to jeal-
ousy's emergence in light of dyadic experiences and as a func-
tion of the social contexts in which these are embraced (Fearon
et al., 2010; Hart, 2012).
Taken together, inquiry into expectations of exclusivity as
they arise across multiple early relationships, even in the absence
of exclusive contact, stands to bolster argument that jealousy
emerges within the first year of life. Moreover, such efforts
should reveal that, even in its normative form, nascent jealousy
is a robust phenomenon. Evidence of its robustness clearly points
to the evolution of functionality that is of profound importance,
and so it is most worthy of investigative attention.
