Abstract
Objective: To determine the effects of propofol and sevoflurane on cytokine levels in children
with community-acquired pneumonia undergoing flexible fibreoptic bronchoscopy (FFB).
Method: Children with community-acquired pneumonia were randomly assigned to receive
3­5 mg/kg propofol i.v. or 8% inhaled sevoflurane. Haemodynamic variables, stress hormone
responses and serum cytokines were compared between the two groups.
Results: Out of 50 children aged 2­12 years (propofol, n ¼ 25; sevoflurane, n ¼ 25), there were no
significant between-group differences in haemodynamic variables and stress hormones. Interleukin
(IL)-6 and IL-10 decreased significantly following FFB in both groups. IL-6 levels were significantly
lower in the sevoflurane group than propofol group at 4 h and 1 d following FFB (61.3 Æ 11.9 versus
82.6 Æ 19.7 pg/ml; 52.8 Æ 9.7 versus 75.4 Æ 13.6 pg/ml, respectively). IL-10 levels in the sevoflurane
group were significantly lower than in the propofol group at 1 d following FFB.
Conclusions: In children with community-acquired pneumonia, use of sevoflurane was associated
with lower circulating IL-6 and IL-10 levels compared with propofol, following FFB. Pneumonia
severity is reflected by higher blood cytokine levels, thus, sevoflurane may be more beneficial to
recovery from community-acquired pneumonia than propofol, however further studies are
required to test this hypothesis.

Introduction
Community-acquired pneumonia continues
to be a common and serious illness in
children.1 The host's inflammatory response
to microorganisms involved in community-
acquired pneumonia is associated with
the release of proinflammatory and anti-
inflammatory cytokines,2 however excessive
cytokine production can cause deleterious
effects.3 The severity of pneumonia is both
reflected and predicted by higher levels of
cytokines in the blood.4
Flexible fibreoptic bronchoscopy (FFB)
is a technique that allows direct visual-
ization of the tracheobronchial tree for
diagnostic and therapeutic purposes in
community-acquired pneumonia. During
FFB, there are two factors that can influ-
ence serum cytokine levels. First, as an
invasive procedure, FFB can irritate and
damage the airway mucosa, activate the
hypothalamic pituitary adrenal axis, and
then induce the stress response and changes
in immune function.5 Secondly, anaes-
thetics used during FFB may have immu-
nomodulatory properties, and can inhibit
the release of cytokines.6,7 Although these
effects may be inconsequential in chil-
dren with a normal functioning immune
system, suppression of the immune res-
ponse may have relevance in children
with a pre-existing immune imbalance, for
example in cases of community-acquired
pneumonia.
Sevoflurane and propofol are widely used
in the induction and maintenance of anaes-
thesia during FFB in children.8 To the best
of the authors' knowledge, there has been
little work focusing on the relationship
between these two anaesthetics and cytokine
release in children with community-acquired
pneumonia undergoing FFB.
In the present study, serum cytokines and
stress hormones were compared in children
with community-acquired pneumonia
undergoing FFB, to investigate the immu-
nomodulatory effects of sevoflurane and
propofol.
Patients and methods
Study population
This randomized parallel-group trial was
conducted at Hubei Maternal and Child
Health Hospital, Wuhan, China between
March 2015 and May 2015. Inclusion criteria
comprised male and female children aged 2­
12 years with a clinical diagnosis of commu-
nity-acquired pneumonia undergoing FFB;
and children classified with American Society
of Anaesthesiologists physical status (ASA)
II or III (http://www.asahq.org/resources/
clinical-information/asa-physical-status-class
ification-system). A diagnosis of community-
acquired pneumonia was defined as radio-
graphic evidence of pulmonary infiltrate
consistent with acute infection requiring anti-
biotic therapy, and the presence of two or
more indications of pneumonia: fever, short-
ness of breath, cough, chest pain, abnormal
white blood cell count or physical signs of
pneumonia on examination (e.g., rales on
auscultation, dullness to percussion, or
egophony).9 Children with a history of
immunosuppression, neutropenia, cardiovas-
cular, endocrinological, hepatic or renal dis-
orders, allergy to opioids, or recent use
(within 3 months prior to study entry) of
analgesics or psychoactive drugs were
excluded from the study. Children who had
experienced FFB within 3 months prior to
study entry were also excluded.
The study protocol was approved by
Hubei Maternal and Child Health Hospital
Ethics Committee (Protocol number:
2015008, Date: March 2nd, 2015) and regis-
tered at www.chictr.org (ChiCTR-TRC-
15006031). This study was conducted
according to the Declaration of Helsinki.
Written informed consent was obtained

from the legal proxies of all participants
before the trial commenced.
Study design
All FFB procedures were performed during
morning hours. Children were randomized
at study entry, using a computer-generated
list, into a propofol group or sevoflurane
group. Coded, sealed envelopes were used
for allocation concealment. The propofol
group received 3­5 mg/kg propofol i.v. infu-
sion, while the sevoflurane group received
oxygen at a flow of 6 l/min and 8% sevo-
flurane by inhalation using a Dra
¨ ger Fabuis
GS Anaesthesia Machine (Dra
¨ ger Medical
AG & Co. KG, Lubeck, Germany); both
groups received 1 mg/kg remifentanil i.v.
injected for 60 s followed by 0.4 mg/kg/min
remifentanil by i.v. infusion. Doses of pro-
pofol and sevoflurane were adjusted to keep
the bispectral index between 40 and 50. The
bronchoscope (Olympus Corporation,
Tokyo, Japan) was introduced through a
bronchoscopy adapter (Covidien LLC, MA,
USA) and a laryngeal mask airway (WEILI
Corporation, Guangzhou, China). Upon
direct visualization of the vocal cords, 1%
lidocaine (maximum 7 mg/kg) was injected
for topical anaesthesia. Bronchoalveolar
lavage was performed using 0.9% NaCl
(maximum 5 mg/kg). All drugs were
discontinued upon completion of the FFB
procedure, and the laryngeal mask airway
was removed when the children were fully
awake.
Phenylephrine (0.05 mg/kg, i.v.) was
administered when mean arterial pressure
was ! 30% reduction from baseline, and
could not be controlled within 5 min by
increasing the level of fluid infusion.
Atropine (0.01 mg/kg, i.v.) was adminis-
tered when heart rate was <80 beats
per min.
Data collection
Heart rate and mean arterial pressure were
monitored and recorded at baseline (T0
), on
completion of FFB (T1
) and 4 h following
FFB (T2
). Duration of the FFB procedure
was also recorded.
Venous blood samples (3 ml) were taken
at six time points: at baseline (T0
); on
completion of FFB (T1
); 4 h following FFB
(T2
); at 1 day following FFB (T3
); at 4 days
following FFB (T4
); and at 7 days following
FFB (T5
). The samples were drawn into
tubes without anticoagulants, and cooled
overnight at 4C before centrifugation at
1000 g for 15 min at 4C. Serum samples
were then collected and stored at À20C
prior to use. Serum levels of stress hormones
(noradrenaline, adrenaline and cortisol,
measured at T0
, T1
and T2
) and the cyto-
kines tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-a, inter-
leukin (IL)-6 and IL-10 were determined by
enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay using
commercial kits (Human Noradrenaline
ELISA, Human Adrenaline ELISA,
Human Cortisol ELISA, Human Cytokine
TNF-a ELISA, Human Cytokine IL-6
ELISA and Human Cytokine IL-10
ELISA; Wuhan Xinqidi Biological
Technology Co., Ltd, Wuhan, China) and
microtiter plates (Wuhan Xinqidi Biological
Technology Co., Ltd) according to the
manufacturer's instructions. A WHYM201
Elisa Microplate Reader (Poweam Medical
Systems Co., Ltd, Jiangsu, China) was used
to analyse the ELISA reactions.
Statistical analyses
The number of patients required for each
study group was estimated according to the
between-group differences in serum IL-6
levels observed in the authors' previous
pilot study (data not shown). It was esti-
mated that to have 80% power of detecting a
30% difference with a type-I error of 5%
464 Journal of International Medical Research 44(3)
using Chinese High Intellectualized
Statistical Software (CHISS 2010;
Yuanyitang Science & Technology, Beijing,
China), a minimum of 22 children were
required in each group. A 10% drop-out
rate was anticipated, thus, a minimal sample
size of 25 was recruited for each group. Data
are presented as mean Æ SD or n prevalence.
Student's t-test was used to compare
between-group age, weight, and duration
of FFB. 2-test was used to analyse categor-
ical data. Two-way repeated measures ana-
lysis of variance followed by multiple
comparisons (least significant difference
testing) was used to evaluate the effects of
time, group, and interaction. Statistical ana-
lyses were performed with SPSSÕ software,
version 13.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA)
for WindowsÕ. A P value < 0.05 was con-
sidered statistically significant.
Results
Out of 56 eligible children initially enrolled,
50 were finally included in the study
(25 received propofol and 25 received sevo-
flurane); six children were excluded because
they refused to participate (Figure 1). There
were no statistically significant between-
group differences in demographic details or
duration of FFB (Table 1). There were also
no statistically significant between-group
differences in type of infection (bacterial or
non-bacterial pneumonia) or numbers who
received steroid therapy (Table 2).
Heart rate and mean arterial pressure
decreased in both groups at the end of FFB
(P ¼ 0.003, P ¼ 0.004) compared with base-
line, and there were no statistically signifi-
cant between-group differences in these
parameters at T0
, T1
and T2
(Table 3).
Stress hormones (noradrenaline, adrenaline
and cortisol) decreased at the end of FFB
(T1
) and 4 h following FFB (T2
) versus
baseline (P < 0.01), and there were no stat-
istically significant between-group differ-
ences at T0
, T1
and T2
(Table 3).
Circulating serum IL-6 and IL-10 levels
decreased significantly following the FFB
procedure in both groups (Table 4).
Circulating IL-6 levels were lower in the
sevoflurane group than the propofol group
at 4 h and 1 day following FFB (61.3 Æ 11.9
versus 82.6 Æ 19.7 pg/ml, P ¼ 0.008; and
52.8 Æ 9.7 versus 75.4 Æ 13.6 pg/ml,
P ¼ 0.017, respectively). Circulating IL-10
levels were lower in the sevoflurane group
than the propofol group at 1 day following
FFB (7.2 Æ 2.1 versus 9.5 Æ 2.4 pg/ml,
respectively, P ¼ 0.023). Serum TNF-a was
also decreased at 4 days and 7 days following
the FFB procedure, and no statistically
significant between-group differences were
observed in terms of TNF-a at any time
point (Table 4).
Discussion
The present study showed that in children
with community-acquired pneumonia
undergoing FFB, serum IL-6 and IL-10
levels were lower in children who received
sevoflurane compared with those who
received propofol, suggesting that different
anaesthetics might inFuence the immuno-
logical response in these patients.
Community-acquired pneumonia is
tightly regulated by cytokines produced by
the immune system in response to causal
microorganisms.10 These cytokines serve to
control infection by leukocyte recruitment
and inFammation, however, persistent and
toxic inflammation can induce an overly
proinflammatory cytokine balance, and lead
to poor patient outcomes.11 Serum IL-6
concentration is a sensitive and specific
measurement for assessing response to infec-
tion treatment, and might be predictive of
death, and rapidity of shock onset.12 Several
studies have shown that IL-6 levels correlate
with illness severity in patients with pneu-
monia.13­15 As an anti-inflammatory cyto-
kine, IL-10 is produced primarily by
monocytes and Th-2 lymphocytes, and can

inhibit the synthesis of proinflammatory
cytokines and suppresses antigen presenta-
tion.16 High or medium concentrations of
IL-6 or IL-10 have been associated with
higher mortality in patients with
pneumonia, and the highest risk of death
when both IL-6 and IL-10 levels were high.17
The present study evaluated changes in
cytokine levels associated with two different
anaesthetics, propofol and sevoflurane,

in children with community-acquired pneu-
monia undergoing FFB. The results showed
that serum TNF-a, IL-6 and IL-10 levels
decreased over time in both groups. One of
the main reasons may have been that FFB is
beneficial to the identification of infection,
and the therapeutic effects of bronchoalveo-
lar lavage may influence treatment outcomes
in cases of pneumonia. The present data
were in contrast to another study,18 in which
serum proinFammatory cytokines increased
following bronchoalveolar lavage in mech-
anically ventilated patients receiving mid-
azolam sedation throughout bronchoscopy.
The main difference between the two studies
was selection of agents for sedation/anaes-
thesia and the experimental subject.
The present study also found that IL-6
was lower in the sevoflurane group at 4 h
and 1 day following FFB compared with the
propofol group. Two main factors that can
induce serum cytokine changes during FFB
are stress stimuli and anaesthesia, however,
both groups employed the same bronchos-
copist and displayed identical serum stress
hormone changes, so it may be reasonable to
infer that the different anaesthetics influ-
enced the release of cytokines in the present
study.
Anaesthetics and sedative agents are
known to possess immunomodulatory activ-
ities.19 Propofol pretreatment has been
demonstrated to significantly suppressed
the lipopolysaccharide-induced toll-like
receptor 4, monocyte differentiation antigen
CD14, and TNF gene expression in an
in vitro study.20 Similar immunomodulatory
effects have been shown in vitro for sevo-
flurane, whereby sevoflurane reduced the
release of inflammatory mediators in endo-
toxin injured alveolar epithelial cells.21
A clinical study also suggested that inflam-
matory responses induced by one-lung

ventilation during lung resection were sig-
nificantly suppressed by sevoflurane com-
pared with propofol.22 The mechanism
behind this immunomodulation may be
reduction of inducible nitric oxide synthase
protein levels and nitric oxide synthase
activity by decrease in intracellular calcium
concentration.23
Opioids have also been shown to have
immunomodulatory effects. Stimulation of
opioid receptors on monocytes leads to a
reduction in intracellular cyclic adenosine
monophosphate, followed by a reduction in
cytokine production.24 In the present study,
both groups received identical opioid regi-
mens, however, children who received sevo-
flurane showed reduced cytokine levels
compared with those who received propofol.
This may be because the effect of sevoflurane
and propofol on cytokines is due to different
mechanisms, and the alveolar epithelial cells
may be influenced by direct contact with
sevoflurane.21 In addition, the bronchodila-
tion effect of sevoflurane may make the
bronchoalveolar lavage more thorough
compared with use of propofol, which may
be beneficial to recovery in patients with
pneumonia, and thus impact the release of
cytokines.
There are some limitations associated
with the present study. First, this was a
single centre trial and sample sizes are
relatively small. Secondly, this study could
not be blinded completely due to the odour
of sevoflurane, which may have influenced
the results relating to duration of bronchos-
copy and anaesthesia. Thirdly, the effects of
the two agents on long term outcomes, such
as antibiotic use, inpatient costs, and patient
outcomes, were not studied, and should be

investigated in a further randomized con-
trolled study. Finally, the aim of the present
study was to identify whether there was a
difference in patient cytokine levels between
use of propofol versus sevoflurane in FFB.
The Chinese clinical trial registry [http://
www.chictr.org.cn/showprojen.aspx?proj¼
10501] states that a healthy control group
would be recruited to investigate cytokine
levels in healthy children versus children
with community-acquired pneumonia (pro-
pofol and sevoflurane groups). Patients with
pneumonia have been shown to display
higher levels of cytokines compared with
healthy controls,25 therefore, the healthy
control group was not recruited.
In conclusion, the present results demon-
strated that sevoflurane was associated with
decreased circulating IL-6 and IL-10 levels
compared with propofol, following FFB in
children with community-acquired pneumo-
nia. As the severity of pneumonia is reflected
by higher cytokine levels in the blood, it
could be inferred that sevoflurane may be
more beneficial to the recovery of commu-
nity-acquired pneumonia compared with
propofol, however, further studies are
required to test this hypothesis.
