Brief Report: Social Risk Factors Predict Cigarette
Smoking Progression Among Adolescents with Asthma
Kenneth P. Tercyak, PHD

Objective To compare smoking progression in adolescents with and without asthma and to
compare their psychosocial risk factors. Methods Participants were 1,507 adolescents with
asthma and 1,507 healthy matched controls from Waves I and II of the Add Health Project
assessed at baseline and again 1 to 2 years later at follow-up. Three levels of smoking progression
(defined as smoking more frequently and/or intensely over time) were identified: (a) Late
Experimenters (never smokers at baseline, ever smokers at follow-up), (b) Early Experimenters
(ever smokers at baseline, current/current frequent smokers at follow-up), and (c) Early Smokers
(current smokers at baseline, current frequent smokers at follow-up). Results Twenty percent
of adolescents experienced progression in their smoking behavior; those with and without
asthma were equally likely to progress. Among adolescents who progressed, 37% were Late
Experimenters, 42% were Early Experimenters, and 21% were Early Smokers. Exposure to
friends who smoked was a consistent and powerful social risk factor for smoking progression
among adolescents with asthma--more so than among adolescents without asthma. This
effect was intensified among Late Experimenters by the presence of a positive history of parent
smoking. Conclusions Findings underscore the importance of addressing cigarette smoking
behavior and its social risk factors among adolescents with asthma in both clinical and public
health contexts, during early adolescence, and through research on this topic.
Key words adolescents; asthma; psychosocial risk factors; smoking.
Cigarette smoking is harmful to all individuals, especially
those affected by chronic illness. To date, the pediatric
psychology literature has largely focused on cigarette
smoking behaviors among healthy youth, with scant
attention paid to youth with chronic conditions. The
few studies that have emerged with a focus on youth
with illnesses, including asthma (Tercyak, 2003;
Zbikowski, Klesges, Robinson, & Alfano, 2002), diabe-
tes (Frey, Guthrie, Loveland-Cherry, Park, & Foster,
1997; Tercyak, 2004), and survivors of childhood cancer
(Emmons et al., 2002; Tyc, Hadley, & Crockett, 2001)
suggest alarming similarities in smoking prevalence
rates between adolescents with and without chronic
illnesses.
Recently, Tercyak (2003) reported on the preva-
lence of smoking among adolescents with asthma who
took part in the National Longitudinal Study of Adoles-
cent Health (Add Health Project). There, the lifetime
prevalence of smoking was 56% among adolescents with
asthma and their prevalence of current smoking was
20%. No differences were observed between adolescents
with and without asthma with respect to lifetime smok-
ing prevalence, though adolescents with asthma were
more likely to be current smokers than were their
healthy counterparts. Psychosocial risk factors for
smoking were highly similar between the two groups,
and included exposure to family members and friends
who smoked, as well as concurrent depression. These

Smoking Progression Among Adolescents with Asthma 247
results are in line with those obtained by Zbikowski et al.
(2002), who also found high smoking prevalence rates
among adolescents with asthma.
At question is whether cigarette smoking behavior
progresses in adolescents with asthma over time, and
whether psychosocial risk factors identified by Tercyak
(2003) and Zbikowski et al. (2002) are predictive of
progression in this population. Adolescent smoking pro-
gression (defined as smoking more frequently and/or
intensely over time) has been the subject of a number of
investigations (e.g., Dierker, Avenevoli, Goldberg, &
Glantz, 2004; Turner, Mermelstein, & Flay, 2004; van
den Bree, Whitmer, & Pickworth, 2004). Understanding
the behavioral epidemiology of cigarette smoking among
individuals with asthma is critical so that more effective
smoking prevention and intervention programs can be
designed and implemented. To address this issue, two
successive waves of Add Health Project data were ana-
lyzed: Wave I data collected at baseline (1994­1995)
and Wave II data collected at follow-up (1996). (Data
for this study were obtained through a contractual
arrangement with the proprietors of the Add Health
Project Waves I and II data sets.) It was hypothesized
that adolescents with asthma would progress in their
smoking behavior at a rate similar to their healthy peers.
Further, that psychosocial risk factors for smoking identi-
fied at baseline (exposure to parents' and friends' smok-
ing, depression) would predict smoking progression in
adolescents with asthma as powerfully as in adolescents
without asthma.
Method
Among the more than 90,000 adolescents enrolled in the
Add Health Project, some 20,000 adolescents and their
parents completed extensive in-home interviews about
adolescent health and well-being (Udry & Bearman,
1998). Taking an hour or more to complete, these inter-
views were individually administered in person in ado-
lescents' homes. Special care was taken to assure
participants that their responses would remain confi-
dential. For example, on sensitive topics adolescents lis-
tened to tape-recorded questions and entered their
answers directly into a laptop computer.
Participants
Wave I
During the Wave I parent in-home interview, parents
reported on a number of parent- , child- , and family-
specific factors, including if the child currently experiences
the health problem of asthma or emphysema (yes/no).
On the basis of parents' responses to this question,
2,073 affected adolescents were identified. (The in-
home interview did not distinguish between asthma
and emphysema as different forms of chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease. However, it is assumed that affected
adolescents were diagnosed with asthma and not emphy-
sema as emphysema usually develops in adulthood, often
after many years of exposure to cigarette smoke and
other air pollutants.)
Adolescents included in the control sample were ran-
domly selected via a computer program from the Wave I
data set after the cases of adolescents with asthma had
been identified. The computer program sought to exactly
match controls to cases on four vital statistics: (a) gender
(male or female), (b) race (Hispanic, Black or African
American, Asian, Native American, Other, White), (c) age
(11­21 years), and (d) the U.S. census region in which the
school the adolescent attended lies (west, midwest, south,
northeast), respectively. A total of 2,039 out of 2,051 cases
(99%) could be matched in this manner. Limitations in the
Add Health Project data set prevented a complete determi-
nation of the health status of these individuals, other than
that they did not have asthma. However, adolescents with
diabetes (n = 78) could be excluded before the selection of
the sample of controls as the Wave I in-home parent inter-
view asked parents to identify whether their adolescent
was affected with diabetes.
Wave II
Cases accessioned in the manner described above were
then screened to determine whether they also had relevant
data (i.e., smoking behavior data) at Wave II. Of the
2,039 cases, 1,507 (74%) answered a critical tobacco use
screening item regarding lifetime cigarette use since the
date the Wave I interview was conducted. There were no
discernible demographic differences at baseline between
adolescents who could or could not be included in the
longitudinal analysis. Only these 1,507 cases and their
matched controls were retained for analysis.
Procedure
In the Add Health Project, the sampling frame included
all high schools in the United States meeting certain eli-
gibility criteria (N = 26,666). A systematic random sam-
ple of 80 high schools and 52 middle schools was then
selected with unequal probability of selection for partici-
pation. Incorporating systematic sampling methods and
implicit stratification into the Add Health Project design
ensured that the sample was representative of U.S.
schools with respect to region of country, urbanicity,
school type, ethnicity, and school size. Overall, 79% of
schools agreed to participate (Resnick et al., 1997).
248 Tercyak
Measures
The following variables/scales were extracted/created
from the Waves I and II adolescent in-home interviews
(Tercyak, 2003).
Wave I: Environmental Smoking Exposure
Two items assessing resident mother and resident father
lifetime cigarette smoking (yes/no), and one item assessing
the number of best friends who smoke at least one cigarette
per day (none, one, two, or three), were included in the
analysis.
Wave I: Depression Symptoms
Resnick et al. (1997) created a reliable (Cronbach  =
.86) multi-item scale of psychological distress/depres-
sion symptoms over the past week for the Add Health
Project data set. This 19-item 4-point Likert scale (0,
"never or rarely"; 1, "sometimes"; 2, "a lot of the time";
3, "most of the time or all of the time") is based, in large
part, on the Center for Epidemiologic Studies-Depression
Scale, which is commonly used with adolescents (Myers
& Winters, 2002); higher item-summed scores indicate
greater depression symptoms. Sample items include
"You felt depressed" and "You felt sad." To ease the
interpretability of this variable, a median-split procedure
determined those adolescents with depression symp-
toms falling at or above the median ("high") from those
with depression symptoms falling below the median
("low").
Waves I and II: Cigarette Smoking
Adolescent cigarette smoking was assessed by a series of
standard epidemiological items regarding the frequency
and intensity of their smoking behavior/lifetime and cur-
rent cigarette smoking. These items were "Have you ever
tried cigarette smoking, even just one or two few puffs?"
and "During the past 30 days, on how many days did
you smoke cigarettes?"
For the purposes of the data analysis, three cigarette
smoking dependent variables were created from Wave I:
lifetime cigarette use (ever tried cigarette smoking, even
one or two puffs), current cigarette use (smoked ciga-
rettes on 1 or more of the past 30 days), and current fre-
quent cigarette use (smoked cigarettes on 20 or more of
the past 30 days). Definitions for each of these variables
were adapted from the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention's Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance System
(Grunbaum et al., 2004). At Wave II, identical variables
were created and analyzed. However, these variables
were specific to the frequency and intensity of smoking
behaviors that had occurred since the date of the Wave I
interview.
Data Analysis
The sample's baseline demographic characteristics, and
smoking exposure and depression variables (indepen-
dent psychosocial risk predictor variables) were
described in univariate fashion, stratified by illness sta-
tus. Equivalency between the groups of adolescents with
and without asthma was confirmed with bivariate statis-
tics. Next, three groups of adolescent cigarette smokers,
distinguished by their smoking frequency and intensity,
were created. Group I, labeled "Late Experimenters,"
consisted of adolescents with a negative history of life-
time smoking at baseline who progressed to a positive
lifetime history by follow-up. Group II, labeled "Early
Experimenters," was comprised of adolescents with a
positive history of lifetime smoking at baseline who pro-
gressed to current smoking or current frequent smoking
by follow-up. And Group III, labeled "Early Smokers,"
was made up of adolescents who were currently smoking
at baseline who progressed to current frequent smoking
at follow-up. Bivariate analyses then tested for differ-
ences in smoking progression (dependent variable)
based on the independent variables of interest; those
with significant (p < .05) associations with progression
were then tested in a multivariate fashion by using logis-
tic regression. These adjusted equations generate odds
ratios (OR) (with 95% confidence intervals [CI]) esti-
mating each variable's influence on smoking behavior
progression 1 to 2 years later.
Results
Univariate and Bivariate Analyses
The sample's M (SD) age was 15.1 (1.6) years (16.1
[1.6] years at follow-up). There were no differences in
the distributions of gender (51% male), race (54%
White), or region (25% northeast, 26% midwest, 32%
south, 17% west) between adolescents with and without
asthma; their ages at follow-up were also comparable.
Thus, the case-control matching procedure was successful.
Regarding cigarette smoking, 596 adolescents
(20%) experienced progression in the frequency and/or
intensity of their smoking behavior from baseline to fol-
low-up, 671 (22%) experienced regression, and 1,747
(58%) were unchanged. Adolescents with and without
asthma were equally likely to experience progression
(Table I), regression, or to remain unchanged. Within
the group of adolescents who experienced progression,
219 (37%) fell into Group I and were Late Experimenters,
252 (42%) fell into Group II and were Early Experi-
menters, and 125 (21%) fell into Group III and were
Early Smokers.
Smoking Progression Among Adolescents with Asthma 249
Independent Predictor Variables Associated
with Smoking Progression
Analyses of independent psychosocial risk predictor
variables associated with smoking progression are pre-
sented in Table I and in the text below.
Of the five variables tested, only exposure to parents
who smoked was significantly associated with any level
of progression among adolescents with asthma; those
exposed to parents who smoked were 50% more likely
to progress than were unexposed adolescents. Among
adolescents without asthma, race and exposure to
friends who smoked were associated with any progres-
sion. Specifically, White adolescents were 40% more
likely to progress than were nonWhite adolescents, OR =
1.40, 95% CI = 1.08, 1.81, p = .01 and adolescents
exposed to friends who smoked were almost 50% more
likely to progress than were unexposed adolescents, OR =
1.47, 95% CI = 1.15, 1.90, p = .003.
Among Late Experimenters (Group I) with asthma,
male adolescents, those exposed to parents who
smoked, and those exposed to friends who smoked were
more likely to progress. Specifically, males were 82%
more likely to progress than females, adolescents
exposed to parents who smoked were 65% more likely
to progress, and adolescents exposed to friends who
smoked were 63% more likely to progress than were
adolescents without those exposures. Among Late
Experimenters (Group I) without asthma, only the effect
of baseline exposure to friends who smoked was signifi-
cant, OR = 1.91, 95% CI = 1.21, 2.99, p = .005.
For both Early Experimenters (Group II) and Early
Smokers (Group III) with asthma, exposure at baseline
to friends who smoked was associated with their smok-
ing progression. For Early Experimenters, those with
friends' exposure were 92% more likely to progress. For
Early Smokers, those with friends' exposure were over 2
times more likely to progress. No variables were associated
with smoking progression among adolescents without
asthma in Groups II and III.
Multivariate Analysis
Because bivariate analyses suggested that more than one
independent variable was associated with progression in
smoking among Late Experimenters with asthma only, a
multiple logistic regression analysis examining the
effects of exposure to parents and friends who smoked
(controlling for adolescent gender) was conducted. Both
main effects and their interaction term were tested. The
results indicated that adolescents with exposure from
parents were 65% more likely to progress (OR = 1.65,
95% CI = 1.07, 2.54, p = .03) and adolescents with expo-
sure from friends were 58% more likely to progress (OR =
1.58, 95% CI = 1.02, 2.44, p = .04); adolescents with
exposure to both parents' and friends' smoking were the
most likely to progress (p = .01). Unadjusted follow-up
contingency tables revealed 10.4% of Late Experiment-
ers progressed when exposed to parent smoking only,
5.4% progressed when exposed to friends smoking only,
and 17.4% progressed when exposed to both risk factors
at baseline.
Discussion
The results of this study suggest that adolescents with
asthma were just as likely as adolescents without asthma
to progress in their smoking behavior over a 1- to 2-year
interval beginning in midadolescence. This appeared to
be true regardless of whether or not adolescents with
asthma had a negative or positive lifetime history of

smoking at baseline, or were currently smoking at baseline.
Further, the results indicated that among adolescents
with asthma, exposure at the beginning of this interval
to friends' smoking was a significant and consistent
social risk factor for smoking progression at three differ-
ent levels of personal smoking behavior. This effect was
intensified at the early stage of smoking experimentation
by the presence of exposure to parents who smoked.
The results are consistent with prior cross-sectional
work with adolescents with asthma suggesting social
factors such as exposure to smoking among family
members and friends may place adolescents at risk for
smoking (Tercyak, 2003; Zbikowski et al., 2002). They
are also consistent with longitudinal research findings
that these risk factors exert an influence over time on
the uptake and progression of adolescent smoking
behavior (Chassin, Presson, Rose, & Sherman, 1996;
Choi, Pierce, Gilpin, Farkas, & Berry, 1997). This
study's unique contribution is in both the identification
and replication of exposure to friends' smoking as a
social risk factor for smoking progression among adoles-
cents with asthma, and its synergistic interaction effect
with exposure to parents' smoking on experimentation.
This study did not demonstrate any effect of depression
symptoms on smoking progression over time. It is
unclear why social factors predicted cigarette smoking
more consistently and powerfully among adolescents
with asthma than among adolescents without asthma.
One possible explanation as to why this may be the case
draws upon previous findings suggesting adolescents
with asthma have more positive attitudes toward ciga-
rettes and smoking, stronger intentions to smoke, and
positive self-image of smokers (Brook & Shiloh, 1993;
Zbikowski et al., 2002). Another is that adolescents with
asthma may more readily succumb to social influences,
including offers from friends to smoke, to fit in with
their peer group and avoid stigmatization as being dif-
ferent because of chronic illness (Zbikowski et al.,
2002).
The results reported should be interpreted in light
of a few limitations. First, changing patterns in the prev-
alence of cigarette smoking among U.S. high school stu-
dents since the time these data were collected in the mid
1990s may limit the relevance of the findings. Second,
adolescents' self-reported cigarette smoking status was
not independently confirmed via biochemical or other
means and may have been subject to biased reporting.
Similarly, parental smoking history was not well detailed
and it is possible that parents stopped smoking before
the adolescent's birth. Third, the Add Health Project offers
relatively crude assessments of smoking progression and
depression; varying levels of smoking experimentation
were not covered and clinical cut-offs for depression are
unavailable. Finally, complete case ascertainment was
not possible at Wave II because of missing data.
These limitations notwithstanding, the findings
underscore the importance of addressing the problem of
smoking among adolescents with asthma. Clinically,
health care providers should routinely screen adoles-
cents and their parents for tobacco use and offer them
education, counseling, and assistance. Overt signs of
smoking, such as the smell or presence of cigarettes, are
also cues to action for providers. Providers should be
aware of the social influences on adolescent smoking
progression too and inquire about smoking among ado-
lescents' peers. Enhancing self-efficacy may be key,
along with providing social skills and cigarette refusal
skills training, to reduce use and prevent or delay smoking
progression among adolescents with asthma (Borrelli
et al., 2002). From a public health standpoint, effective
ways to reach adolescents with asthma or other chronic
illnesses and deliver and tailor smoking prevention and
cessation messages to this special population are not
known. More research in these contexts seem warranted.
