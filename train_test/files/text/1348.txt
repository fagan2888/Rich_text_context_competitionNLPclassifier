Obes Res. 2003;11:1159-1162.
Objective: To examine the association between BMI (kilo-
grams per meter squared) and reports of significant knee,
hip, and back pain using data from a nationally representa-
tive sample of U.S. adults 60 years or older.
Research Methods and Procedures: Population-based sur-
vey data from the Third National Health and Nutrition
Examination Survey, involving 5724 adults 60 years or
older, were used. BMI, calculated from measured weight
(kilograms) and height (meters squared), was used to cate-
gorize participants into six BMI-defined groups: under-
weight (18.5), desirable weight (18.5 to 24.9), overweight
(25 to 29.9), obese class I (30 to 34.9), obese class II (35 to
39.9), and obese class III (40). The presence of significant
knee, hip, and back pain in the groups was studied.
Results: The overall prevalences of knee, hip, and back pain
were 21%, 14%, and 22%, respectively. Prevalence esti-
mates for knee (underweight 12.1% to obesity class III
55.7%), hip (underweight 10.4% to obesity class III 23.3%),
and back (underweight 20.2% to obesity class III 26.1%)
pain increased with increased BMI. Sex-, race-, and age-
specific pain prevalence estimates also generally increased
at increased levels of BMI.
Discussion: Among U.S. adults 60 years or older, the prev-
alence of significant knee, hip, and back pain increases with
increased levels of BMI.

trition Examination Survey
Introduction
The prevalence of both obesity and its associated health
problems continues to increase dramatically in the U.S. (1).
It is estimated that between 1991 and 1998, the prevalence
of obesity among adults 60 to 69 years old and over 70 years
increased by 44.9% and 28.6%, respectively (2).
Musculoskeletal pain of the knee, hip, and back are
among the most frequently occurring and debilitating
chronic medical conditions affecting the U.S. population
(3). Overall, painful disorders of the musculoskeletal system
are the leading cause of work-related disability among men
and women 16 to 72 years old and the leading cause of
disability among Americans over the age of 65 (4,5).
The purpose of this study, therefore, was to examine the
relationship between BMI (kilograms per meter squared)
and reports of significant knee and hip pain, using data from
a nationally representative sample of U.S. adults 60 years or
older.
Research Methods and Procedures
The Third National Health and Nutrition Examination
Survey (NHANES III)1 was conducted by the Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention, National Center for Health
Statistics. NHANES combines a home interview with health
tests that are done in a mobile examination center. The plan
of operation of NHANES III has been described in detail
elsewhere (6,7). In brief, this survey collected information
about health and diet in a nationally representative sample

of the civilian noninstitutionalized U.S. population. Another
important purpose of this survey was to estimate the preva-
lence of a variety of health conditions and risk factors.
Operationally, NHANES III represented a 6-year study,
involving two 3-year phases conducted from 1988 to 1994.
NHANES III collected its data in two 3-year phases because
each phase was considered nationally representative so that
interim analyses could be done when Phase I was com-
pleted. The results presented herein are derived from both
phases of the NHANES III data collection. Mexican Amer-
icans, non-Hispanic blacks, and older adults were over-
sampled in NHANES III to ensure weighted, unbiased es-
timates from these particular groups.
Survey interviews took place in the participants' homes,
followed 2 to 3 weeks later by a detailed clinical/physical
examination conducted in a mobile examination center.
Interviews and examinations were conducted on 5724 adults
60 years or older. Interviewers were well experienced, and
many were of Hispanic origin or fluent in both English and
Spanish. All staff underwent yearly training sessions to
ensure quality control.
Study Variables
Self-reported race and ethnicity were used to classify
participants as non-Hispanic white, non-Hispanic black, or
Mexican American (i.e., persons of Mexican origin living in
the U.S.). Age was defined as the age in years at the time of
the household interview and, for analytic purposes, catego-
rized into three groups (60 to 69 years, 70 to 79 years, and
80 years).
During the medical examination, height was measured
using a stadiometer, and weight was measured on a balance
beam scale. Height and weight data were then used to
calculate BMI. BMI is largely independent of height (r 
0.03), strongly related to weight (r  0.86), and a reason-
able measure of adiposity (8). Based on the weight classi-
fications developed by the National Heart Lung and Blood
Institute (9), we grouped participants according to six BMI-
defined categories (18.5, "underweight"; 18.5 to 24.9,
"desirable weight"; 25 to 29.9, "overweight"; 30 to 34.9,
"obesity class I"; 35 to 39.9, "obesity class II"; and 40,
"obesity class III").
Participants were asked three separate questions to assess
significant knee, hip, and back pain (i.e., "whether they had
experienced significant knee pain on most days over the
preceding 6 weeks," "whether they had experienced signif-
icant hip pain on most days over the preceding 6 weeks,"
and "whether they had experienced significant back pain on
most days for at least 1 month and have had this pain within
the past 12 months"). The pain-related questions asked in
NHANES III are well-validated (10).
Statistical Analysis
We performed the statistical analyses using SAS and
STATA statistical software (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC).
For each survey, we calculated sample weights that took
account of the unequal selection probabilities resulting from
both the cluster design and the planned over-sampling of
certain subgroups. Prevalence estimates were derived and
are presented for the sex, race, and age categories as de-
scribed above. All analyses reported have incorporated sam-
pling weights.
Results
The overall prevalences of significant knee, hip, and back
pain were 21%, 14%, and 22%, respectively. Table 1 pre-
sents the sex-, race-, and age-specific prevalence estimates
of older U.S. adults reporting significant knee, hip, or back
pain in each of the six BMI-defined weight classifications
(see Table 1). For all three sites of pain, prevalence esti-
mates increased with increased BMI. The relation between
BMI and pain prevalence was stronger for knee pain (un-
derweight 12.1% to obesity class III 55.7%) than for either
hip (underweight 10.4% to obesity class III 23.3%) or back
pain (underweight 20.2% to obesity class III 26.1%).
In general, the sex-, race-, and age-specific pain preva-
lence estimates also increased at increased levels of BMI.
Exceptions included: for knee pain, the estimates for men,
non-Hispanic blacks, and Mexican Americans; for hip pain,
the estimates for women, non-Hispanic blacks, and those at
80 years of age; and for back pain, the estimates for
women, non-Hispanic blacks, and those at 80 years of
age. In these subgroups, we observed roughly J- or U-
shaped relations between BMI and pain prevalence.
Discussion
These cross-sectional population-based survey data indi-
cate that, among adults 60 years and older, the prevalence of
significant knee, hip, and back pain increases markedly with
increased BMI. The estimated prevalence of knee pain
increased by 44% over the range of BMI (i.e., from 12% for
underweight participants to 56% for obesity class III par-
ticipants), and a similar pattern, though not as pronounced,
occurred with regard to the prevalences of hip and back
pain.
This general pattern of findings remained even when we
calculated the pain prevalence estimates along the six BMI-
categories according to sex-, race-, and age-specific sub-
groups. The few exceptions to this pattern tended to show a
J-or U-shaped relationship between pain prevalence and
BMI, that is, higher pain prevalence estimates at the lower
and higher BMI categories. The reasons for the nonlinear
pattern are unknown but may relate to errors introduced by
the self-reporting of pain or sampling variation. Perhaps,
however, for some reason, (e.g., occupational knee de-
mands, underlying illness), there is a true difference in the
association within the lower and upper BMI categories for

certain subgroups. Understanding the reasons for these dif-
ferences requires further investigation.
The observed BMI-pain associations are consistent with
what has been observed among persons with obesity seek-
ing weight loss using university-based treatments (11,12)
and in the small body of work (e.g., 13,14) suggesting that
weight reduction can reduce reports of musculoskeletal
pain.
It is important to note that self-reports of pain in
NHANES III were not verified objectively. Moreover, the
cross-sectional nature of the NHANES III does not allow us
to test causal inferences (i.e., determine whether BMI pre-
ceded the pain or vice versa) nor determine whether the
association between weight and pain is mediated by condi-
tions such as osteoarthritis or diabetic neuropathy. None-
theless, one could speculate that, given the established link
between obesity and osteoarthritis of the knee and hip
(15,16) and between obesity and back pain (17), maintain-
ing a healthy weight may reduce the prevalence of knee,
hip, and back pain in older adults. However, whether inten-
tional weight loss would reduce the prevalence of reports of
significant knee, hip, and back pain in older adults remains
uncertain.
