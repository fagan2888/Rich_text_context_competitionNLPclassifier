Objective: To determine if there is a relationship be-
tween parental perception of neighborhood safety and
overweight at the age of 7 years.
Design: Cross-sectional analysis of the National Insti-
tute of Child Health and Human Development Study of
Early Child Care and Youth Development.
Setting: Ten urban and rural US sites.
Participants: A total of 768 children selected via condi-
tional random sampling with complete data at follow-up.
Main Outcome Measures: Parents reported demo-
graphics and perception of neighborhood safety by stan-
dardized questionnaire. Child overweight status was de-
fined as a body mass index greater than or equal to the 95th
percentile for age and sex from measured anthropomet-
rics at the age of 7 years. The base model included rela-
tionship of the safety reporter to the child, sex, and base-
line body mass index z score at the age of 4.5 years.
Covariates tested included maternal marital status, educa-
tion, and depressive symptoms; child race/ethnicity; par-
ticipation in structured after-school activities; Home Ob-
servation for Measurement of the Environment total score;
and neighborhood social cohesiveness.
Results: The sample was 85% white, and 10% of the chil-
dren were overweight. Neighborhood safety ratings in the
lowest quartile were independently associated with a
higher risk of overweight at the age of 7 years compared
with safety ratings in the highest quartile (adjusted odds
ratio, 4.43; 95% confidence interval, 2.03-9.65). None
of the candidate covariates altered the relationship be-
tween perception of neighborhood safety and child over-
weight status.
Conclusions: Perception of the neighborhood as less safe
was independently associated with an increased risk of
overweight at the age of 7 years. Public health efforts may
benefit from policies directed toward improving both ac-
tual and perceived neighborhood safety.

THE MOST RECENT US NA-
tional data confirm the
growing obesity epidemic:
15.8% of 6- to 11-year-old
children are overweight
(defined as a body mass index [BMI]
95th percentile for age and sex)1 and the
racial disparities continue to increase.2
Well-described risk factors for childhood
overweight in the United States include
African American or Hispanic race/
ethnicity,2 elevated parental BMI,3,4 and a
large amount of television viewing.5 The
most recent data suggest that lower socio-
economic status is associated with over-
weight in children,4,6 but the relationship
is complicated and appears to vary based
on a combination of sex, age, race/
ethnicity, and the degree of poverty.7 The
home environment and parenting have re-
ceived significant attention in the litera-
ture,4,8-11 but the neighborhood and built
environment as independent contribu-
tors to child overweight risk have not been
examined as thoroughly. The built envi-
ronment, which has been associated with
other health outcomes,12-15 has been rec-
ognized by the Centers for Disease Con-
trol and Prevention as a potentially im-
portant area for public policy to address
the childhood obesity epidemic16 and an
area that requires additional research.17
Our clinical experience in an urban pe-
diatricclinicthatservesalow-incomepopu-
lation has been that unsafe neighborhoods
significantly affect children's daily activi-
ties. Anecdotally, parents in an urban set-
ting frequently express their reluctance to
allow their children to play outside for fear
of exposure to violence, crime, and illicit
drug use. Prior assessments of perception
of neighborhood safety have focused on
physical activity levels as an outcome18,19 or
used children's (not parents') assessments
of neighborhood safety.19 However, paren-
tal perception of neighborhood safety may
be more salient than the child's perception
because parents of young children typi-

cally exert substantial control over where their children
spend time.
We therefore sought to document our clinical impres-
sion by investigating the relationship between parental
perception of neighborhood safety and overweight in chil-
dren at the age of 7 years in 10 diverse regions of the
United States. We focused on overweight at the age of 7
years because overweight prevalence increases most rap-
idly in childhood around this age,1 and the racial/ethnic
disparities in overweight prevalence also widen signifi-
cantly during this same period of childhood.1 We hy-
pothesized that parents who perceive their neighbor-
hood as unsafe would be more likely to have overweight
children because they restrict their children's access to
outdoor activities. We also hypothesized that this rela-
tionship would be attenuated by the availability of an after-
school program, a stimulating home environment, or in-
creased social cohesiveness in the neighborhood. In
examining these hypotheses, it is critical to control for
potentially confounding factors known to be associated
with obesity.
METHODS
The sample was composed of children and their parents en-
rolled in the National Institute of Child Health and Human De-
velopment Study of Early Child Care and Youth Development
(NICHD-SECCYD). The NICHD-SECCYD20 is a longitudinal
study of relationships between child behavior and develop-
ment and key developmental contexts, especially child care ex-
perience. Families who participated in this study were re-
cruited through hospital visits to mothers shortly after the birth
of a child in 1991. Families lived in the areas of Little Rock,
Ark; Irvine, Calif; Lawrence, Kan; Boston, Mass; Morganton,
NC; Philadelphia, Pa; Pittsburgh, Pa; Charlottesville, Va; Se-
attle, Wash; and Madison, Wis.
Of the 8986 mothers who gave birth during the sampling
period, 5416 (60%) met the eligibility criteria. Mothers were
required to be healthy, to be older than 18 years, to not be plan-
ning to move within the next year, to live within an hour of
the study site, and to be conversant in English with a single-
ton child whose birth was normal and uncomplicated. An ad-
ditional inclusion criterion at the Philadelphia site was that fami-
lies live in a neighborhood that was not extremely unsafe as
documented by local police, given the planned home visits. One
hundred thirty-one families (1.4% of the original pool of 8986
potential families) were excluded for this reason. Notably, the
study protocol for the duration of the study dictated that if the
neighborhood was deemed too unsafe for a home visit, the home
visit would still be completed but with a security guard or po-
lice officer present.
Of the 5416 eligible families, 3015 (56%) were selected using
a conditional random sampling plan that ensured that the re-
cruited families reflected economic, educational, and ethnic di-
versity.21 Ofthe3015familiesselectedforparticipation,1526(51%)
agreed to participate. Of the 1526 families who agreed to partici-
pate, 1364 (89%) completed the initial data collection.20 This ini-
tial sample was representative of the demographics of the catch-
ment areas from which the sample was recruited: 24% of the
children were of an ethnic/racial minority, 10% of the mothers
had less than a high school education, and 14% of the mothers
were single at the time of the child's birth. The study involved
extensive data collection at frequent intervals. Data used in this
analysis were collected during assessments scheduled for chil-
dren at the age of 4.5 years and in the spring and fall of the child's
first grade year in school. This study was approved by the insti-
tutional review boards of all pertinent institutions.
PERCEPTION OF NEIGHBORHOOD SAFETY
The Neighborhood Questionnaire is a 16-item measure of neigh-
borhood characteristics that was completed during the child's
first-grade year in school by the mother and another adult liv-
ing in the home who acted as a caregiver (hereafter referred to
as the father). More than 85% of these caregivers were fathers,
9% were the mother's partner, and the remainder were grand-
parents or relatives.22 Two scales of the Neighborhood Ques-
tionnaire are the Neighborhood Safety Subscale (NSS) and the
Neighborhood Social Involvement Subscale.23
The NSS score consists of the mean of 5 items. On the over-
all Neighborhood Questionnaire, the number of possible re-
sponse categories (eg, items on the Likert scale) varied from 2
to 10, and on the NSS, response categories varied from 4 to 5.
Responses were therefore rescaled to a 0 to 10 range and av-
eraged to provide the overall score via the methods used in the
original scale. Parents responded to the following questions:
(1) "How do you feel about your neighborhood?" (2) "How
satisfied are you with police protection around here?" (3) "How
often are there problems with muggings, burglaries, assaults,
or anything else like that around here?" (4) "How much of a
problem is the selling and using of drugs around here?" and
(5) "How well do the police and people in this neighborhood
get along?" Higher scores represent greater perceived neigh-
borhood safety.
All 768 children had an NSS score from at least 1 reporter;
739 had an NSS score from 2 reporters, one of whom was al-
ways the mother. The NSS scores differed significantly based
on the identity of the reporter, with mothers perceiving the
neighborhood as slightly safer than fathers (=0.16; P=.004).
When both parents completed the NSS questionnaire, we used
the score that reflected a perception of the neighborhood as less
safe based on the assumption that the parent who had the great-
est concern about safety would do more to control the child's
access to people and places outside the home. We therefore con-
trolled for the identity of the neighborhood safety reporter a
priori in the base model.
OVERWEIGHT STATUS
Height and weight were measured during the laboratory visit
at the age of 4.5 years and in the spring of the child's first grade
year in school (when children in the United States are on av-
erage 7 years old). Trained research assistants certified for ac-
curacy in measurement weighed the children, who were lightly
clothed and without shoes, on a physician's scale (Detecto phy-
sician's scale model 437, Cardinal/Detecto, Webb City, Mo) to
the nearest 100 g. Children's height was measured without shoes,
using a T square, to the nearest 0.3 cm. Details of the measure-
ment procedures are documented elsewhere.24 The BMI was cal-
culated as weight in kilograms divided by the square of height
in meters, and child overweight was defined dichotomously as
a BMI greater than or equal to the 95th percentile for age and
sex based on National Center for Health Statistics norms.25
INDEPENDENT VARIABLES
Demographic data consisted of the child's sex, race/ethnicity
(white, black, or other), maternal marital status (single vs not),
and maternal education (years of education completed). Ma-
ternal education was included as a continuous variable. We
elected to use maternal education as our measure of socioeco-
nomic status because this variable had the most complete data

of the available indicators. Maternal education was correlated
with income-to-needs ratio (Spearman rank correlation=0.59;
P.001).
Additional characteristics assumed to modify an association
between perception of neighborhood safety and overweight were
tested as potential covariates. These included maternal scores on
the Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale26 re-
ported during the child's first grade year, the child's participa-
tioninstructuredafter-schoolactivities(dichotomizedas1hour

hood Social Involvement Subscale of the Neighborhood Ques-
tionnaireduringthechild'sfirst-gradeyear,andqualityofthehome
environment as measured by the Home Observation for Mea-
surement of the Environment (HOME) total score. The HOME
was administered by trained observers during home visits at the
child's age of 4.5 years. The HOME is an observational measure
ofthestimulationandsupportavailabletothechildinthehome.27
The NICHD-SECCYD did not include maternal anthropometric
data or child television-viewing patterns in the time frame of this
analysis.
STATISTICAL ANALYSIS
All data analysis was performed using SAS statistical software,
version 8.2 (SAS Institute Inc, Cary, NC). In our analyses, we
excluded children without data for NSS scores (n=337) or BMI
at first grade (n=371). Children who had moved residences in
the past 12 months were also excluded (n=162), since we were
interested in assessing the role of the neighborhood in over-
weight risk. We examined the sample included in our model
(n=768) vs those excluded because of missing data (n=596)
and found statistically significant differences. Although the NSS
scores did not differ significantly (P=.76), children included
in the sample were more likely to be overweight (10% vs 6%;
P=.002), slightly more likely to be female (51% vs 45%; P=.05),
more likely to be white (85% vs 75%; P.001), and had moth-
ers who were more educated (14.7 vs 13.7 years; P.001). Ad-
ditional information regarding differences in the samples is avail-
able from the authors on request.
Univariate statistics were first computed to provide a de-
scription of the sample of 768 children. We dichotomized the
child's BMI at the age of 7 years as overweight (BMI 95th per-
centile) vs not overweight to create a dependent variable that
could be used in a multiple logistic regression model.
Then, bivariate analyses were performed to inform the de-
velopment of the multivariate model. We analyzed all covari-
ates by overweight status using t tests for continuous variables
and cross-tabulations with 2 tests. We analyzed associations
between NSS scores and these covariates with t tests, analysis
of variance, and correlation coefficients. To characterize the re-
lationship among neighborhood safety, race/ethnicity, and so-
cioeconomic status, we regressed the NSS score on race/
ethnicity and socioeconomic status. We also performed a cross-
tabulation of overweight status and NSS score in quartiles (with
cut points at the scores 6.83, 7.67, and 8.67) to assess poten-
tial nonlinearity in their relationship. We next fit logistic re-
gression models with overweight status as the outcome.
We accounted for clustering by site with bias-corrected gen-
eralized estimating equations based on the methods of Mancl
and DeRouen.28,29 We computed both unadjusted and ad-
justed odds ratios and their corresponding 95% confidence in-
tervals from these logistic regression models. We used an  level
of.05(2-tailed)todeterminestatisticalsignificance.Abasemodel
for estimating overweight status on the parent's perception of
neighborhood safety was created including child sex and iden-
tity of the safety reporter a priori.
Each of the candidate covariates was then tested by entering
them one by one into the base model. Covariates that altered the
relationship of NSS scores to child overweight in these models
by more than 10% were retained in the final model.30 Although
this method of modeling is not able to test for potential joint con-
founding, limiting the number of covariates included simulta-
neously in the model allowed us to maintain the stability of the
model. In addition, variables found to be differentially distrib-
uted between those in the analysis sample and those not in the
sample were evaluated for potential confounding effects.
RESULTS
The sample included 768 children. The meanÂ±SD age
of the children at the time of the anthropometric mea-
sures in the spring of first grade was 7.0Â±0.3 years (range,
6.3-8.1 years). Approximately half of the sample were male
and 10% were overweight, consistent with national data
for children of this age.31 The meanÂ±SD NSS score was
7.69Â±1.5 (range, 1.3-10.0; potential range, 0.0-10.0). The
NSS scores were normally distributed with a slight posi-
tive skew. Of the mothers, 42% had at least a bachelor's
degree; 20% had a high school education or less
(Table 1). Overweight children had mothers who were
less educated and came from homes with lower HOME
scores. However, overweight children did not differ
from children who were not overweight by sex, race/
ethnicity, relationship of the safety reporter to the child,
maternal marital status, maternal depressive symptoms,
amount of structured after-school activities, or Neigh-
borhood Social Involvement Subscale scores (Table 1).
In bivariate analyses, lower parental neighborhood
safety ratings were associated with African American race,
lower maternal education, more maternal depressive
symptoms, fewer structured after-school activities for the
child, and a lower HOME total score. Child sex, child
age (restricted to first grade), and maternal marital sta-
tus were not related to parental neighborhood safety rat-
ings (Table 2).
In an attempt to better characterize perception of neigh-
borhood safety in relation to race/ethnicity and socio-
economic status, we performed regression analysis of race/
ethnicity on parental neighborhood safety ratings,
adjusting for maternal education as a proxy for socio-
economic status. Given the limited sample size, we cat-
egorized race/ethnicity as white and nonwhite. Race/
ethnicity was significantly independently associated with
parental perception of neighborhood safety. White par-
ents were significantly more likely to perceive the neigh-
borhood as safe (meanÂ±SD NSS score,7.83Â±1.39) than
were nonwhite parents (meanÂ±SD NSS score, 6.84Â±1.82),
independent of socioeconomic status (P.001).
OVERWEIGHT STATUS AND
NEIGHBORHOOD SAFETY
Results from the bivariate analyses showed that parents
of children who were overweight in first grade per-
ceived their neighborhoods as significantly less safe than
parents of children who were not overweight (P.001)
(Table 1). We next evaluated the unadjusted risk of over-
weight in each quartile of NSS scores in a cross-

tabulation and found higher risk of overweight in quar-
tiles 1 through 3 compared with neighborhoods perceived
as most safe (NSS scores in quartile 4). We found that
17% of those in the first quartile (least perceived neigh-
borhood safety) were overweight compared with 10% in
the second quartile, 13% in the third quartile, and only
4% in the fourth quartile (highest perceived safety). We
also estimated this relationship in logistic regression mod-
els that accounted for clustering by site (Table 3). The
relationship between parental perception of neighbor-
hood safety and a higher risk of overweight in first grade
persisted in the base model, which controlled for child
sex and identity of the neighborhood safety reporter
(Table 3). Neither child sex nor identity of the safety re-
porter, variables included as confounders a priori, was
significant in the model. None of the candidate covari-
ates altered the relationship between perception of neigh-
borhood safety and overweight in first grade by more than
10%. We tested for the presence of interactions between
the covariates by adding terms to the multiple logistic
regression model. We examined interactions of percep-
tion of neighborhood safety and sex, perception of neigh-
borhood safety and identity of safety reporter, and iden-
tity of safety reporter and sex. None of these interactions
were statistically significant.
CONTROLLING FOR BMI z SCORE AT 4.5 YEARS
By adding BMI z score at the age of 4.5 years as a con-
tinuous variable into the base model (which included child
sex and identity of the safety reporter) as a covariate, we
were able to statistically control for variability in BMI al-
ready present at the age of 4.5 years. Statistical removal
of this variability enabled us to focus on overweight that
developed between the ages of 4.5 and 7 years. If adjust-
ing for BMI z score at the age of 4.5 years had signifi-
cantly reduced or eliminated the association between NSS
scores and overweight status at the age of 7 years, it would
suggest that children were overweight before parental NSS
scores were obtained and therefore weaken the explana-
tory model. Adjusting for BMI z score at the age of 4.5

years in the base model, the relationship between paren-
tal perception of a less safe neighborhood and child over-
weight in first grade remained, although slightly weak-
ened. Per our stated methods, we re-entered the same
candidate covariates into the base model one by one and
retained those that altered the relationship between per-
ception of neighborhood safety and overweight in first
grade by more than 10%. Again, none of the covariates
altered the relationship between parental perception of
neighborhood safety and overweight in first grade, and
none of the interactions examined were statistically sig-
nificant. The change in the odds ratio for overweight risk
when controlling for BMI z score at 4.5 years indicates
that parental perception of neighborhood safety inde-
pendently increases overweight risk in the age range of
4.5 to 7 years, although the effect also operates to some
degree at younger ages (Table 3).
COMMENT
Results from a diverse sample representing 10 different
sites across the United States indicate that parental per-
ception of the neighborhood as unsafe was indepen-
dently associated with an increased risk of overweight
at the age of 7 years. To our knowledge, this study is the
first to systematically investigate the relationship of pa-
rental perception of neighborhood safety and child-
hood overweight in a sample with geographic, ethnic, and
socioeconomic diversity while analytically controlling for
a large number of potentially confounding factors.
Previous studies in children that focused on the rela-
tionship among neighborhood safety, physical activity,
and BMI have shown conflicting results. In a study19 of
Hispanic, white, and Vietnamese fourth graders of di-
verse socioeconomic status, children's (not parents') per-
ceptions of a more dangerous neighborhood were asso-
ciated with increased self-reported physical activity and
lower BMI. Another study18 of chronically ill 10- to 12-
year-old children linked decreased activity patterns to
child and parent perception of less neighborhood safety,
but the generalizability of this study to healthy children
is unclear. The differences in our findings and these prior
studies may be partially explained by the low correla-
tion between child and parental report of neighborhood
violence32 or the younger age of children in our study.
Parental perception of neighborhood safety likely oper-
ates more strongly than that of the child in altering life-
style because parents exert significant control over young
children's activities.33,34
We were concerned that region of residence might me-
diate the relationship between neighborhood safety and
overweight, but accounting for clustering based on study
site did not alter the relationship. Measures of socioeco-
nomic status also did not eliminate the observed asso-
ciation between perception of neighborhood safety and
overweight, which would be the case if parental percep-
tion of neighborhood safety were only a proxy for socio-
economic status. In addition, potential protective fac-
tors, such as structured after-school activities, increased
social cohesion in the neighborhood, or a high-quality
home environment did not alter the relationship be-
tween parental perception of neighborhood safety and
overweight. In effect, there may well be a relatively simple
and straightforward relationship between living in a dan-
gerous neighborhood and overweight; namely, in at-
tempting to protect their children from harm, parents not
only decrease the kind of physical activity that comes from
playing outdoors in the neighborhood but inadvert-
ently increase the likelihood of sedentary activity and
snacking that comes from staying indoors.
We found significant differences in perception of neigh-
borhood safety based on race/ethnicity. Most US neigh-
borhoods continue to be racially segregated.35 It is pos-
sible that one of the many contributors to the racial
disparities in overweight prevalence2 may be higher crime
rates and lower perception of neighborhood safety among
African Americans.34,36 However, our study included a
relatively small sample of children of minority race/
ethnicity. Our inability to detect the well-documented
differences in overweight prevalence by race/ethnicity,
presumably because of low statistical power, suggests that
these findings may not be generalizable to populations
of minority race/ethnicity. The role of perceived neigh-
borhood safety as a possible mediator between minority

POLICY IMPLICATIONS
Although violent crime rates are lower today than they
have been in 10 years, less than 10% of people report that
their fear of crime has decreased.36 It is therefore impor-
tant not only to understand contributors to increased vio-
lence and crime but also to understand and address the
factors that contribute to the perception that a neigh-
borhood is unsafe. A potential area for intervention is the
redesign of neighborhoods. Individuals who perceive their
neighborhoods as unsafe cite open drinking and drug use
as significant contributors to feeling unsafe.36 As re-
viewed by Ashe et al,37 land use planning and zoning has
long been used to address endemic public health prob-
lems and could be used creatively to address the child-
hood obesity epidemic by improving some of the fea-
tures that contribute to increased neighborhood violence
and the perception of the community as unsafe. In con-
sidering neighborhood redesign, the National Institute
of Health recently outlined a research agenda.38 Of the
issues that require further study, identifying factors that
mediate or moderate built environment effects was of pri-
mary importance. No matter how neighborhoods are re-
designed to allow children to walk to school or the neigh-
borhood store, parents must feel safe allowing their
children to do so.
STUDY LIMITATIONS
Our study has several limitations. The findings may not
be generalizable to certain populations, such as recent
immigrants or the children of adolescent mothers. Our
sample size of overweight children was relatively small.
Therefore, the power to detect some of the differences
may have been limited. We also did not have measures
of actual neighborhood violence. However, prior data have
indicated that poor, urban, African American mothers'
ratings of their neighborhood quality correlate with ac-
tual crime rates.39 Parents likely base their decisions on
whether to send their children outside on their percep-
tion of neighborhood safety and not on statistics, which
may account for a prior study40 not showing an associa-
tion of neighborhood crime statistics with overweight in
preschoolers. We did not have data regarding physical
activity measures or diet, which limits our ability to evalu-
ate potential mechanisms of the association. Finally, as
with many studies of this nature, the sample with com-
plete data included in our analysis differs from the sample
without complete data; therefore, our findings may not
be generalizable to the reference population of the
NICHD-SECCYD. Although we tested covariates that are
predictors of missingness as potential covariates in the
model and they did not alter the results, it remains pos-
sible that our results would have differed had complete
data for the entire sample been available.
The independent effect of the neighborhood is chal-
lenging to study owing to difficulties in controlling for
individual-level characteristics that may act as confound-
ers.41 Our data set does not include maternal weight; there-
fore, we were unable to control for this. However, we be-
lieve it is unlikely that maternal weight status is
independently related to perception of neighborhood
safety and therefore do not believe this would have acted
as a significant confounder. We also did not have a mea-
sure of television viewing in our data set. An unsafe neigh-
borhood may reduce outside activity, increase televi-
sion viewing, and thereby increase the risk of overweight.
However, amount of television viewing and overweight
in young children has not been as strongly associated as
it has been in older children.5,42 Therefore, it seems un-
likely that inclusion of television viewing would have
eliminated the relationship. In addition, studies of ma-
ternal obesity or child television viewing as risk factors
did not include neighborhood safety as a covariate. Un-
derstanding the independent role of each of these vari-
ables will depend on a study that is able to include all of
them in predicting child overweight.
SUMMARY
These data show a significant relationship between pa-
rental perception of an unsafe neighborhood and over-
weight at the age of 7 years even when many potentially
confounding variables are controlled, including base-
line BMI 3 years before the measures of interest. Many
areas of policy development related to the built environ-
ment and neighborhood safety have not traditionally been
considered relevant to child health. However, such poli-
cies may have important implications for childhood over-
weight. For the individual physician, these results sug-
gest the need to understand the character of a child's
neighborhood when making recommendations for life-
style and activity changes aimed at obesity prevention and
treatment.
