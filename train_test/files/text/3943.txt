Abstract
For centuries, oil paintings have been a major segment of the visual arts. The JenAesthetics data set
consists of a large number of high-quality images of oil paintings of Western provenance from
different art periods. With this database, we studied the relationship between objective image
measures and subjective evaluations of the images, especially evaluations on aesthetics (defined as
artistic value) and beauty (defined as individual liking). The objective measures represented low-
level statistical image properties that have been associated with aesthetic value in previous
research. Subjective rating scores on aesthetics and beauty correlated not only with each other
but also with different combinations of the objective measures. Furthermore, we found that
paintings from different art periods vary with regard to the objective measures, that is, they
exhibit specific patterns of statistical image properties. In addition, clusters of participants
preferred different combinations of these properties. In conclusion, the results of the present
study provide evidence that statistical image properties vary between art periods and subject
matters and, in addition, they correlate with the subjective evaluation of paintings by the
participants.

Introduction
In his book Vorschule der A
¨sthetik, Gustav Theodor Fechner (1876) laid the foundations for
a new scientific discipline, that is, the systematic search for stimulus properties that are
associated with beauty (experimental aesthetics). He was one of the first to directly
measure such properties in aesthetic stimuli. Nowadays, a large number of firmly
established empirical methods are applied in this field. A particular focus has been on
statistical image properties (SIPs) that are relevant to visual perception in humans. For
many years, researchers have explored whether SIPs provide objective criteria to assess the
aesthetic quality of artworks and photographs. Their goal was (and is) to identify universal
features that are positively correlated with beauty and aesthetic experience. Until now, no
such universals have been found. The main reason for this might be that experiences of
beauty are--at least partly--domain specific (Markovic
´ , 2014). For example, the concept
that the Golden Section--as proposed by Gustav Theodor Fechner--is universally perceived
as beautiful across domains has been questioned and eventually rebutted (McManus, 1980;
Russell, 2000). Over the past few years, more sophisticated analysis methods have been used
to search for properties related to beauty in a specific domain, namely visual art (Graham &
Redies, 2010; Hoenig, 2005). In the field of computational aesthetics, computer-assisted
algorithms were used to extract statistical features that characterize aesthetic images
(Amirshahi, Koch, Denzler, & Redies, 2012; Datta, Joshi, Li, & Wang, 2006; Graham &
Field, 2007; Redies, Hasenstein, & Denzler, 2007). This approach has also been employed to
predict emotional responses to paintings (Yanulevskaya et al., 2012) and to categorize
painting styles (Wallraven et al., 2009).
Large subsets of Western and East Asian visual artworks share the property of a nearly
scale-invariant (fractal-like) Fourier spectrum (Alvarez-Ramirez, Ibarra-Valdez, Rodriguez,
& Dagdug, 2008; Graham & Field, 2007, 2008; Graham & Redies, 2010; Redies, 2007; Redies
et al., 2007) with images of complex natural scenes (Burton & Moorhead, 1987; Field, 1987;
Geisler, 2008; Ruderman & Bialek, 1994). This finding led to the hypothesis that many artists
apply natural scene statistics when they create artworks (Graham & Redies, 2010; Redies,
2007). Another computational method for analyzing artworks is based on the analysis of
histograms of oriented luminance gradients (HOGs; Bosch, Zisserman, & Munoz, 2008). This
method allows calculating image properties such as self-similarity, complexity, and
anisotropy (Amirshahi et al., 2012; Redies, Amirshahi, Koch, & Denzler, 2012). Results
indicate that images of artworks exhibited in museums and images of natural scenes are
highly self-similar, that is, subparts of the images have HOGs similar to the entire image
(Amirshahi et al., 2012; Amirshahi, Redies, & Denzler, 2013). In other words, artworks
possess a relatively high degree of self-similarity in comparison to other image categories
(Braun, Amirshahi, Denzler, & Redies, 2014). In addition, large subsets of visual artworks
have complexity values in an intermediate range (Braun et al., 2014). This finding is in line
with the proposition by Berlyne (1974) that an intermediate level of complexity is associated
with higher aesthetic appeal than low or high complexity on average, as experimentally
confirmed by several studies (Forsythe, Nadal, Sheehy, Cela-Conde, & Sawey, 2011;
Nadal, 2007). Furthermore, colored artworks are, in general, highly isotropic, that is, they
contain luminance gradients of similar strength across all orientations (Braun et al., 2014;
Koch, Denzler, & Redies, 2010; Melmer, Amirshahi, Koch, Denzler, & Redies, 2013). In our
study, we measured the following SIPs: PHOG (Pyramid of HOGs) Self-Similarity, HOG
Complexity, HOG Anisotropy, Aspect Ratio, Rule of Thirds, and various color measures.
For an exact definition of these measures, see the Methods section. To measure these
properties in images of artworks, we used the JenAesthetics database, which was
2 i-Perception
introduced by Amirshahi, Denzler, et al. (2013). The data set consists of over 1,600 high-
quality images of oil paintings of Western provenance. We used this type of artworks because
it has been very popular over several centuries and thereby offers the opportunity to compare
different art periods. For the rating experiment, we excluded more recent oil paintings (i.e.,
paintings with a year of origin later than 1935) and thereby eliminated paintings that are not
intended to be visually pleasing. Furthermore, a previous study showed that representational
paintings can be associated with more positive judgments on the dimensions of form,
complexity, and regularity, as compared with abstract paintings (Markovic
´ , 2011).
A major concern regarding the analysis of the SIPs in this database was the age of some of
the paintings, which can result in conservation artifacts, for example, a brownish film of
varnish that may partially obscure color and luminance detail in the paintings (Bonaduce
et al., 2012). We analyzed paintings in their present condition, in which museums made them
available to the Google Art Project.
The subjective rating scores of the paintings have been obtained and analyzed in a
previous study (Amirshahi, Hayn-Leichsenring, Denzler, & Redies, 2014a). Each image in
this database was subjectively rated according to its aesthetics and its beauty. Aesthetics
reflected the (``more objective'') artistic value of the respective image while beauty stands
for the ``subjective'' liking by the individual participant. Given that there is some uncertainty
with regard to the terminology (Augustin, Carbon, & Wagemans, 2012; Augustin,
Wagemans, & Carbon, 2012), the terms were explicitly defined for the participants of the
experiment (see section ``Gaining of Subjective Rating Scores''). Hedonic value is used in the
manuscript as a superordinate term for aesthetics and beauty. The present work extends the
study by Amirshahi et al. (2014a) (a) by performing a deeper analysis of the subjective rating
scores, (b) by analyzing the SIPs of the paintings, and (c) by investigating the relation
between SIPs and the rating scores of the paintings.
Besides the search for universal aesthetic features, another interesting research topic is the
identification of statistical properties that are characteristic for particular art periods.
Marchenko, Tat-Seng, and Irina (2005) used computer algorithms based on the
measurement of color temperature (warm or cold), color palette (primary or
complimentary), and color contrasts (light or dark) to distinguish modern art from medieval
art. Therefore, low-level statistics can provide informative cues about art periods. In the
so-called ontology-based disambiguation method, Leslie, Chua, and Ramesh (2007) combined
analyses of color measures and brush strokes with semantic high-level concepts to distinguish
art periods; they achieved a higher performance than with the approach by Marchenko et al.
The influence of higher level in categorization strategies has also been demonstrated by
Wallraven et al. (2009). Hence, we did not only focus on the investigation of possible
universal features of art images but expanded our effort toward an investigation of the
usefulness of SIPs for allowing to differentiate art periods and subject matters.
In previous studies, rating scores on art paintings have been linked to interindividual
differences between participants, such as personality traits (Furnham & Walker, 2001;
Lyssenko, Redies, & Hayn-Leichsenring, 2016), expertise (Aluja, Garcia, & Garcia, 2004;
Leder, Ring, & Dressler, 2013), demographic variables (Furnham & Walker, 2001) and other
personal characteristics. For example, Mallon, Redies and Hayn-Leichsenring (2014) found
that preferences differed between subgroups of participants depending on the SIPs of abstract
paintings. Although the clustering of the participants was performed exclusively based on
subjective evaluations, 46% of the clustering's outcome was predicted by SIPs of the
evaluated paintings. Gu
¨ clu
¨ tu
¨ rk, Jacobs, and van Lier (2016) described that two clusters of
participants differed in their liking of complexity in digital images. One group of participants
showed increasingly lower liking rates for increasingly more complex images while another
Hayn-Leichsenring et al. 3
group showed the opposite pattern of preference. Bies, Blanc-Goldhammer, Boydston,
Taylor, and Sereno (2016) found different preferences for clusters of participants who
rated fractal patterns. These preferences correlated with specific patterns of fractal
dimension, symmetry, and recursion in the stimuli. Together, these results indicate that
different groups of people have different preferences for specific SIPs. Here, we
investigated whether clusters of participants preferred certain SIPs over others in the
images of the JenAesthetics database.
In summary, we provide a detailed statistical analysis of the subjective evaluations of the
JenAesthetics database. Specifically, we connected the subjective rating scores with the SIPs.
In addition, we reanalyzed the data set for individual art periods and subject matters to find
out whether specific subsets of the JenAesthetics database differ in their SIPs or in the
correlation between rating scores and the SIPs.
Methods
Data Set
We used the JenAesthetics data set (Amirshahi et al., 2012). This data set consists of 1,628
images of colored oil-paintings of Western provenance painted by over 400 artists. For
technical reasons, we used 1,614 of the images only. The JenAesthetics data set is a subset
of the Google Art Project database and therefore royalty free. All images were of high
resolution (image size generally more than 3 MB; e.g., see Figure 1 images).
Categorization of Paintings
As described in a technical report (Amirshahi et al., 2012), each image of the JenAesthetics
database was categorized according to the art period and its subject matter. The
categorization of the art periods followed standard textbooks on art and information
available on the Wikipedia website. The data set contains works from 11 major art periods
(Renaissance, Mannerism, Baroque, Rococo, Classicism, Romanticism, Realism,
Impressionism, Symbolism, Post-Impressionism, and Expressionism). The categorization of
subject matter of each painting is based on a subjective classification by two independent
observers. Subject matters are abstract, nearly abstract, landscapes, scenes with person(s), still
life, flowers or vegetation, animals, seascape, port or coast, sky, portrait (one person), portrait
(many persons), nudes, urban scenes, buildings, interior scenes, and other subject matters. Up
to three subject matters were assigned to one particular painting. However, in our analysis,
we used only the first (predominant) subject matter of each painting.
Gaining of Subjective Rating Scores
In the present study, we used the rating scores for the JenAesthetics database, which were
obtained in a previous study (Amirshahi et al., 2014a). In this study, participants rated the
paintings on aesthetic value, beauty, liking of color, liking of content, liking of composition,
familiarity with the artist, and familiarity with the painting. Before the experiment,
participants were instructed that ratings on aesthetics should reflect the (``more objective'')
artistic value of the respective image while beauty rating scores should reflect the ``subjective''
liking. In brief, the 1,614 paintings were rated in blocks of 163 randomly chosen images.
Every painting was rated by 19 to 20 participants (131 participants in total). The rating
experiment was performed with images that were reduced to a size of 800 pixels on the
4 i-Perception
longest side (maximum size of 205 mm on the screen). Images were presented on a black
screen (BenQ T221W widescreen monitor) that had been color calibrated using a colorimeter
(X-Rite EODIS3 i1Display Pro). For a more detailed description of the experimental
procedure, see Amirshahi et al. (2014a).
Statistical Image Properties
For every painting, we calculated the following statistical properties using MATLAB 2008A:
(1) PHOG Self-Similarity. Self-similarity implies that an object as a whole has a structure
similar to its parts. In the present study, we calculated Self-Similarity using the PHOG
method, as originally introduced by Bosch et al. (2008). In brief, the method follows a
pyramid approach (Amirshahi et al., 2012): In a first step, the HOG feature (Dalal et al.,
2005) for the entire image is calculated at the ground level (Level 0). The HOG feature
represents the mean strength of the luminance gradients binned in 16 equally sized
orientations that cover all orientations in the image. Second, the image was divided
into four rectangles of the same size (Level 1), and the HOG features were calculated
for each subimage. Then, each of the four rectangles was again divided into equal
rectangles (Level 2), and the HOG features were calculated for the resulting 16

subimages as well. We took this approach up to Level 3. Then, we compared the HOG
features of the entire image on Level 0 with the HOG features of the rectangles on the
third level using the Histogram Intersection Kernel (Barla et al., 2002). A detailed
description of the method (Amirshahi et al., 2012) can be found in the Appendix to
Braun et al. (2014). This measure ranges from 0 (no self-similarity) to 1 (maximal self-
similarity).
(2) HOG Complexity. Several recent studies confirmed the importance of complexity in
aesthetic perception (Bies et al., 2016; Forsythe et al., 2011; Jacobsen & Hofel, 2002;
Rigau, Feixas, & Sbert, 2008). Here, we defined Complexity as the total strength of all
oriented gradients in a painting (Redies et al., 2012).
(3) HOG Anisotropy. Anisotropy is a measure for the heterogeneity (variance) of luminance
gradients across orientations in a particular image. High values indicate that some
orientations of gradients are represented more strongly than others in the HOGs,
while low values imply that the luminance gradients are uniformly distributed across
all orientations (Redies et al., 2012). Schweinhart and Essock (2013) showed that art
paintings of different subject matters (e.g., landscapes and faces) tend to be less
anisotropic even though, in real-world photographs, the pattern of anisotropy differs
considerably between landscapes and faces. Possibly, artists over regularize the
structure in their paintings by imposing the natural-scene horizontal effect in other
types of subject matter.
(4) Aspect Ratio. Although there is no evidence for an overall hedonic preference of a certain
format of paintings (McManus, 1980; Russell, 2000), the aspect ratio has been linked
previously to the aesthetic preference of paintings depicting specific subject matters, for
example, landscapes or portraits (Palmer, Schloss, & Sammartino, 2013). Therefore, we
included this measure because it might be related to preferences for images from specific
art periods or of specific subject matters.
(5) Rule of Thirds. We measured the degree, to which images structure followed the Rule of
Thirds (see Amirshahi, Hayn-Leichsenring, Denzler, & Redies, 2014b). The Rule of
Thirds implies that the focus point of a painting should be placed along one of the
third lines to yield aesthetically pleasing results. In the present study, the focus point
was determined based on the graph-based visual saliency method, as described by Mai,
Le, Niu, and Liu (2011).
(6) Color measures. In addition, we calculated the three color measures of the HSV color
space (color hue, color saturation, and color value), which have been regularly used in
aesthetic quality assessment (e.g., see Datta et al., 2006; Palmer et al., 2013). All color
measures range from 0 to 1. Color hue ranges from red (value ¼ 0), yellow, green, cyan,
blue, to magenta (value ¼ 1). For color saturation, higher values stand for higher
saturated images and for color hue, higher values stand for brighter images.
Clustering of the Paintings and Participants
We divided the paintings with the k-means clustering method according to their mean
subjective rating scores on aesthetics and beauty. Clustering allowed allocation of paintings
into three subgroups that resembled each other according to correlation patterns. This number
of clusters was judged to be close to optimal based on the elbow criterion, a computational
feature in plots of the sum of squared errors. We used the same method (but based on
correlations of subjective ratings with SIPs) for the clustering of the participants.

Results
Analysis of SIPs
Correlation between SIPs. The measured SIPs correlate with each other (see Supplementary
Table 1 for a detailed analysis of correlations of SIPs within the JenAesthetics database).
For example, there is a high correlation between Self-Similarity and Anisotropy (r ¼ À483,
p < .001). Bearing this in mind, we performed detailed statistical analyses on SIPs over
paintings and over participants.
Analysis Over Paintings
Correlation of SIPs with year of origin. First, we investigated whether the SIPs of the paintings
changed over the years. Therefore, we correlated the year of origin of the paintings with the
SIPs. We found significant correlations for most of the SIPs, namely for Self-Similarity
(Pearson's r ¼ .204, p < .001), Complexity (r ¼ .127, p < .001), Anisotropy (r ¼ .090,
p < .001), Aspect Ratio (r ¼ À.182, p < .001), Rule of Thirds (r ¼ À.107, p < .001), Color
Saturation (r ¼ À.287, p < .001), and Color Value (r ¼ .425, p < .001). Therefore, image
statistics changed over time. More recent oil paintings are more self-similar and more
complex. Also, they possess a higher degree of Anisotropy and show different colors.
SIPs in paintings from different art periods. We then analyzed whether paintings from the various
art periods differed in their SIPs.
The results were entered into a one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) considering art
period as between-subject factor. Results revealed a significant effect of all measured SIPs:
Self-Similarity, F(10, 1603) ¼ 11.344; p < .001, Complexity, F(10, 1603) ¼ 17.685; p < .001,
Anisotropy, F(10, 1603) ¼ 4.596; p < .001, Aspect Ratio, F(10, 1603) ¼ 11.742; p < .001,
Rule of Thirds, F(10, 1603) ¼ 7.040; p < .001, Color Hue, F(10, 1603) ¼ 16.319; p < .001,
Color Saturation, F(10, 1603) ¼ 20.184; p < .001, and Color Value, F(10, 1603) ¼ 51.913;
p < .001. Therefore, all measured SIPs showed differences over the art periods analyzed
(see Supplementary Table 2 for descriptive statistics and Supplementary Table 3 for results
of a multivariable linear regression analysis that studied the interaction between the SIPs in
one model and their affiliation to a specific art period and Supplementary Figure 1 for a plot
of the LOESS curve fittings for aesthetics and beauty). In addition, we performed a
multinomial multivariable regression analysis for art period with all SIPs. Results showed
that all SIPs are significant predictors of the art period affiliation. For example, an increase of
saturation of 0.1 increases the probability of belonging to the art period Renaissance by
79.8% as compared with the reference art period Impressionism (see Table 1 for complete
results).
SIPs in paintings with different subject matters over art periods. Next, we compared the SIPs of
landscape and portrait paintings between different art periods. We used landscape and
portrait paintings because these subject matters were the most numerous within the
JenAesthetics database and, additionally, they were also common to all art periods.
The results were entered into a one-way ANOVA considering art period as between-
subject factor. For portrait paintings, results revealed a significant effect of Complexity,

F(10, 428) ¼ 18.486; p < .001. Only Self-Similarity, F(10, 428) ¼ 1.686, ns, had no effect.
Therefore, only Self-Similarity did not differ significantly in portrait paintings over the art
periods.
For landscape paintings, results revealed a significant effect of Self-Similarity, F(9, 168) ¼
3.411; p ¼ .001, Complexity, F(9, 168) ¼ 6.326; p < .001, Rule of Thirds, F(9, 168) ¼ 3.054;

and Color Value, F(9, 168) ¼ 6.239; p < .001. In landscape paintings, Anisotropy,
F(9, 168) ¼ .844, ns, and Aspect Ratio, F(9, 168) ¼ .980, ns, did not differ significantly
between art periods.
In conclusion, all SIPs show changes throughout the art periods, except for Self-Similarity,
which does not change in portrait paintings, and Anisotropy and Aspect Ratio, which are
unaltered in landscape paintings (see Supplementary Table 4 for the descriptive statistics on
landscape paintings and portrait paintings for every art period). To detect the influence of
SIPs and subject matter (independent variables) including their interaction on aesthetics
(dependent variable), a multivariable linear regression model was fitted (see Supplementary
Table 5 for results and Supplementary Table 6 for descriptive statistics on all subject
matters).
Subjective rating scores and year of origin of the paintings. The year of origin of the paintings
correlated positively with beauty (r ¼ .168, p < .001), liking of color (r ¼ .054, p < .05),
liking of content (r ¼ .306, p < .001), liking of composition (r ¼ .092, p < .001), familiarity
with the artist (r ¼ .280, p < .001), and familiarity with the painting (r ¼ .050, p < .05).
Interestingly, evaluation on aesthetics showed no correlation (r ¼ À.011, p ¼ .673). We
performed a Fisher transform to investigate whether differences of correlations between
aesthetics or year of origin and beauty or year of origin were significant. To this aim,
we converted Pearson's r to Fisher's z and computed the confidence interval at 99%.
Results showed a significant difference of the correlations. This is particularly striking
because subjective evaluation on beauty and aesthetics (see Introduction for definition of
the terms) are highly correlated (r ¼ .772, p < .001). Therefore, participants personally
preferred newer paintings while the ascribed (``objective'') artistic value remained stable
over time.
General analysis of subjective rating scores in different art periods. Next, we investigated general
differences of subjective rating scores between the art periods. Although each art period is
obviously related to the year of origin, participants might be less familiar with certain art
periods than with others and, therefore, they might systematically prefer paintings from
particular art periods, irrespective of their year of origin. The subjective rating scores were
entered into a one-way ANOVA considering art period as between-subject factor. Results
revealed a significant effect of scores on aesthetics, F(11, 1605) ¼ 18.249; p < .001, as well as
on scores on beauty, F(11, 1605) ¼ 17.155; p < .001. Thus, although we found no general
effect of the year of origin on aesthetics, there are still differences in appreciation for the
different art periods (see Figure 2 for mean scores for the respective art periods).
Subjective rating scores and SIPs. We investigated the relation between subjective rating scores
and the SIPs. To this aim, two stepwise (backward elimination) multiple linear regression
analyses were run. The subjective rating scores (aesthetics or beauty) were the dependent
variables while standardized (z-transformed) values for SIPs were considered independent
variables. Results were controlled with the post hoc Holm­Bonferroni method. Four of the
SIPs predicted subjective ratings on aesthetics, F(4, 1609) ¼ 14.465; p < .001. These were

Value (b ¼ .188, t ¼ 7.380, p < .001), and Self-Similarity (b ¼ À.093, t ¼ À3.765, p < .001).
In addition, in a correlation analysis after Fisher's z transformation, we found that
correlations with Aspect Ratio and Color Value only were significantly different for the
hedonic ratings. Therefore, aesthetics and beauty ratings showed an overall similar pattern
of correlations with the SIPs.
Subjective rating scores on preferences for color, composition, and content correlated with
several SIPs (see Table 2 for details).
Subjective rating scores and SIPs in paintings from different art periods. Next, we investigated
correlations between subjective rating scores and the SIPs for different art periods. Here,
we focused on the subjective rating scores for aesthetics and beauty and investigated only art
periods with more than 30 paintings in the database (see Table 3). Interestingly, the number
of correlations of subjective rating scores differed between art periods. There were no
correlations with the SIPs for Mannerism, Classicism, Romanticism, Symbolism, and
Expressionism, and few correlations for Renaissance, Realism, Impressionism, Post-
Impressionism, and Expressionism. In contrast, Baroque and Rococo showed correlations
of subjective rating scores with several SIPs.
These results provide evidence that the evaluation of artworks from certain art periods
(Baroque, Rococo) by our observers is correlated with particular SIP patterns, while this is
not the case for artworks from other art periods (Mannerism, Classicism, Romanticism,
Symbolism, and Expressionism).

Subjective rating scores and SIPs in paintings with different subject matters. We investigated
correlations between subjective rating scores and the SIPs for different subject matters that
comprised more than 30 paintings. Again, we focused on subjective rating scores for
aesthetics and beauty. In paintings of landscapes, flowers or vegetation, seascapes, and
portraits with many persons, there were no correlations of subjective rating scores with the
SIPs, while paintings with other subject matters showed at least some correlations.
Particularly, the hedonic evaluation of paintings of buildings seems to be connected with
SIPs (especially with Self-Similarity, Color Saturation, and Color Value; see Table 4 for

subject matters only.
Clustering based on subjective rating scores on aesthetics and beauty. To gain insight into the
evaluations on artistic value (aesthetics) and subjective liking (beauty) and their relation to
SIPs, we clustered the paintings (for a description of the method, see Methods section). We
calculated the standard deviation of the mean values of each image from the mean of each
cluster for two to six clusters. An elbow criterion provided evidence that three is the optimal
number of clusters. The clusters consisted of 750, 481, and 383 paintings, respectively. While
Cluster 1 (aesthetics: M ¼ .56, beauty: M ¼ .50) and Cluster 3 (aesthetics: M ¼ .44, beauty:
M ¼ .37) had significantly higher ratings on aesthetics than on beauty, Cluster 2 (aesthetics:
M ¼ .67, beauty: M ¼ .66) consisted of paintings that had a similar mean value of ratings on
aesthetics and beauty. Next, we asked whether the three clusters had different mean values of
SIPs (see Table 5 for results). We found significant differences of mean values between
Clusters 1 and 2 for Anisotropy (two-samples t test: T(1229) ¼ À2.966, p < .01), Rule of

paintings in Cluster 2 (for which subjective rating scores of aesthetics and beauty had a similar
mean value) differ in their mean value for several SIPs.
In addition, we performed a stepwise (backward elimination) multivariable linear
regression analysis over all paintings (from all clusters). The mathematical difference
aesthetics minus beauty was considered as dependent variable while standardized (z-
transformed) values for SIPs were considered independent variables. Results were
controlled with the post hoc Holm­Bonferroni method. Four of the SIPs predicted the
difference between subjective ratings, F(4, 1609) ¼ 67.410; p < .001. These were Color
Value (b ¼ À.238, t ¼ À9.812, p < .001), Aspect Ratio (b ¼ .191, t ¼ 7.958, p < .001), Color
Hue (b ¼ À.092, t ¼ À3.931, p < .001), and Anisotropy (b ¼ À.072, t ¼ 3.080, p ¼ .01). We
conclude that differences in evaluation on aesthetics and beauty--or the ascribed artistic
value and the subjective liking--might depend on SIPs.
After clustering, 29.8% of the paintings were assigned to Cluster 2. However, when
analyzed over art periods, we found that the percentage of paintings assigned to Cluster 2
differed. For Renaissance (C2 ¼ 7.2%), Mannerism (C2 ¼ 5.5%), and Expressionism
(C2 ¼ 3.1%), there were only few paintings in Cluster 2, while for Romanticism
(C2 ¼ 43.7%) and for Impressionism (C2 ¼ 47.1%), Cluster 2 comprised numerous
paintings. Therefore, the artistic value and subjective liking that participants ascribed to
romantic and impressionist paintings were similar. Participants ascribed artistic value to
paintings from Renaissance, Mannerism, and Expressionism although they did not like
these paintings subjectively to the same degree (see Figure 3(a) for detailed results).
Analyzed over subject matters, Cluster 2 contained only a few paintings from the
categories nearly abstract (C2 ¼ 14.2%), animals (C2 ¼ 14.2%), sky (C2 ¼ 18.2%), and
portraits with one person (C2 ¼ 18.9%), while paintings in the categories of landscapes
(C2 ¼ 49.4%), seascapes (C2 ¼ 66.7%), urban scenes (C2 ¼ 52.3%), and buildings
(C2 ¼ 52.7%) were more numerous. In summary, especially in paintings of wide scenes, the
subjective rating scores on aesthetics and beauty were similar (see Figure 3(b) for detailed
results).
Analysis Over Participants
General analysis. For the analysis over participants, we focused solely on the subjective rating
scores on beauty (reflecting the individual liking of the images), because we were interested in
the participants' personal taste and not in what they considered to be generally aesthetic.
Overall, the mean of the subjective rating scores on beauty was M ¼ .416 (SD ¼ .338). Not
surprisingly, participants that reported interest in arts gave higher ratings than participants
that did not report interest in arts (interested: M ¼ .431, SD ¼ .081; noninterested: M ¼ .386,
SD ¼ .015; two-samples t test: T(116) ¼ 2.447, p < .05).

Clustering over SIPs. We calculated Pearson's correlation coefficient for subjective rating scores
on beauty with SIPs of the rated paintings for every single participant (see Supplementary
Table 7 for a complete analysis).
As the correlations were heterogeneous among the participants, that is, groups of
participants showed a particular pattern of correlations with certain SIPs, we divided the
Figure 3. Analysis of image clustering. Displayed are the percentage number of paintings assigned to the
three clusters for (a) art periods and (b) subject matters. Clustering of the images was based on their mean
subjective rating scores on aesthetics and beauty. Cluster 1 consisted of 750 images (46.5% of all images),
Cluster 2 consisted of 481 images (29.8%), and Cluster 3 consisted of 383 images (23.7%).

pattern. For the clustering, we calculated the standard deviation of the mean values of

three clusters is optimal. These three clusters consisted of 29, 37, and 65 participants,
respectively.
To further justify our clustering, we calculated the mean correlations of subjective rating
scores on beauty with SIPs for each cluster. Participants in two of three clusters (Clusters 1
and 2) showed a strong relation between subjective rating scores and SIPs, while SIPs had
only a small effect on subjective rating scores of participants in Cluster 3 (see Figure 4 for
results).
The results were entered into a one-way ANOVA considering cluster affiliation as
between-subject factor. Results revealed a significant effect of Self-Similarity, F(2, 128) ¼

Tukey HSD test indicated a significant difference between individual clusters for mean
values of each SIP analyzed.
Discussion
Statistical Image Properties
One of the central questions in experimental aesthetics is whether there is a ``universal
beauty'' in artworks, natural scenes, and faces. In recent years, this question has been
studied by novel computational methods that allow measuring specific image properties. In
this context, the comparison between aesthetic and ordinary (nonaesthetic) images is of
particular interest. For example, Braun et al. (2014) investigated SIPs in different
Figure 4. Analysis of participant clustering. Mean correlations (Pearson's r) of subjective rating scores
on beauty with SIPs for each cluster. Clustering of participants was based on the correlation of beauty ratings
with SIPs.

categories of images. They showed that artworks, as a category of images that are created to
be aesthetic, exhibit a relatively high degree of Self-Similarity, a low degree of Anisotropy,
and an intermediate degree of Complexity. In these statistical measures, art paintings differ
from other image categories like photographs of natural scenes, urban scenes, faces, and
simple objects, as well as advertisements, on average. Here, we investigated the SIPs of oil
paintings. We asked whether SIPs differed between art periods and between depicted subject
matters in this set of paintings. Therefore, we investigated these subgroups of paintings
separately. Our results show that, for each SIP, there are significant differences between
art periods (see SIPs in paintings from different art periods section). Therefore, we did not
obtain evidence that some SIPs are stable over all art periods investigated. However, in a
more detailed analysis, we found that Anisotropy did not differ significantly over landscape
paintings while it differs between art periods in portrait paintings. Conceivably, Anisotropy is
uniformly high in landscape paintings because horizontal orientations (e.g., horizon) and
vertical orientations (e.g., trees) predominate in real-natural scenes. The opposite pattern
was observed for PHOG Self-Similarity, which differed in landscape paintings over art
periods but did not differ over portrait paintings (see SIPs in paintings with different
subject matters over art periods section). Our results are similar to findings by Redies
et al. (2007) who showed that the Fourier slopes of grayscale art portraits did
not resemble those of face photographs but of natural scenes. They concluded that
artists portray faces not by mere copying of their real-world counterparts but by using
specific divergent image statistics. In the present study, we provide another example for
the usage of particular image properties (i.e., PHOG Self-Similarity) in artistic renderings
of faces.
Fourier slope and Self-Similarity are correlated in artworks (Braun et al., 2014). Not only
do artists portray faces with statistics divergent from real-world faces, but they also
use relatively stable statistics to do so. Overall, our results provide evidence that artists
from all art periods endow oil paintings of particular subject matters with similar image
properties.
Subjective Rating Scores
The terminology that relates to aesthetic experience has been widely discussed in aesthetics
research (Augustin, Carbon, et al., 2012; Augustin, Wagemans, et al., 2012). Here, we
distinguish between aesthetics and beauty ratings. Participants were instructed that ratings
on aesthetics should reflect the (``more objective'') artistic value of the respective image while
beauty rating scores should reflect the subjective liking (see Introduction and Gaining of
Subjective Rating Scores sections). Rating scores differed between art periods, with
classicist paintings evaluated as most aesthetic and impressionist paintings evaluated as
most beautiful (see Figure 2). Overall, participants subjectively preferred more recent
paintings while their rating of ascribed artistic value (i.e., aesthetics) was relatively stable
over the centuries (see Subjective rating scores and year of origins of the paintings section).
Consequently, we propose that, on the one hand, contemporary observers prefer more recent
oil paintings, possibly because they are more familiar with them. On the other hand, the
observers appreciated the artistic expertise of painters in the different periods to the same
degree. This is in line with the notion that the skills of artists are more or less stable on
average over the centuries. Unlike artistic skills, the taste of individual observers changes over
time and, therefore, contemporary participants prefer more modern paintings in general. This
preference might be based on a mere exposure effect for more recent paintings or,
alternatively, on a shared preference for similar semantic content. Previously, it had been
16 i-Perception
shown that visual preferences can be based on the semantic content of stimuli and shared
semantic interpretations can lead to shared preferences (Vessel & Rubin, 2010).
Interestingly, ratings on aesthetics and beauty were quite similar for impressionist
paintings. Therefore, impressionist paintings are valued artistically (objectively) to the same
degree as subjectively. Again, this result may be explained by the greater familiarity of the
observers with impressionist paintings in comparison to paintings from other art periods.
Focusing on the subject matter, ratings on aesthetics and beauty were similar in paintings
of large-vista scenes (like landscapes, seascapes, urban scenes, and buildings). Interestingly,
for some subject matters, aesthetics scores were higher than subjective liking (beauty) scores,
especially for portrait and animal paintings. This difference might be explained by the content
of the images. For example, in portrait paintings, participants might appreciate their artistic
value, but they do not like the image subjectively, possibly because the liking or disliking of
the displayed person might have an effect on this rating. Last but not least, no subset of
images was rated as highly beautiful but not as aesthetic.
Subjective Rating Scores and SIPs
It has been shown that specific SIPs are related to the hedonic value of abstract art paintings
(Mallon et al., 2014). In the present, more detailed study, we show that rating scores on
artistic value correspond to a slightly greater extent with SIPs than rating scores on subjective
liking (see Table 1). It is not surprising that the more objective ratings on aesthetics correlate
stronger with objective image properties, such as specific SIPs.
In addition, we clustered paintings according to their ratings on aesthetics and beauty. We
found that differences in rating scores correlated with specific SIPs, especially with
Anisotropy, Rule of Thirds, Color Saturation, and Color Value (see Clustering based on
subjective rating scores on aesthetics and beauty section). This result points to an interaction
between objective properties (SIPs) and the subjective evaluation of the images. However,
these differences might also be explained by other factors (e.g., preference for specific
contents or styles that coincide with certain SIPs in the paintings). In addition, this finding
does not hold for all art periods because hedonic evaluation is not correlated with SIPs for
Mannerism, Romanticism, and Symbolism. Hence, the subjective liking of paintings from
these periods must be driven by other factors.
We observed similar differences for subject matters (see Table 3). Here, we found that
ratings of each subject matter correlated--at least weakly--with specific SIPs. Especially the
rating of buildings showed relatively high correlations with Self-Similarity, Color Saturation,
and Color Value.
Analysis Over Participants
In addition to our analysis of paintings, we also searched for similarities in the evaluations by
the participants. In previous research, rating scores on art have been linked to expertise
(Leder et al., 2013), personality traits (Lyssenko et al., 2016), and other characteristics of
participants. Furthermore, it has been demonstrated that individuals exhibit stable patterns
of preference for fractal-like characteristics across different image types (Spehar, Walker, &
Taylor, 2016). In the present study, we focused on preferences for SIPs in groups of
participants. We analyzed three clusters of participants. Affiliation to a certain cluster
reflects a specific rating pattern that correlates, in turn, with preferences for images with
specific SIPs. Two of the clusters showed multiple correlations of rating scores on beauty with
particular SIPs (Figure 4). In Clusters 1 and 2, Self-Similarity, Complexity, Anisotropy,
Hayn-Leichsenring et al. 17
Color Saturation, and Color Value of the painting had an effect on the subjective preference,
while in Cluster 3, the SIPs were not correlated with preferences (see Clustering over SIPs
section). Hence, about two thirds of the participants were (perhaps unconsciously) sensitive
to image statistics. A possible reason for this finding is that paintings of similar content or art
style have similar image statistics. Therefore, a coherent taste may coincide with a preference
for similar image statistics. Notably, the third group of participants showed only very few
correlations of subjective ratings with SIPs. Perhaps, these participants possessed a rather
incoherent taste or, possibly, a taste for different image features or statistical properties that
have not been measured in the present study. Alternatively, their preference for paintings
might be driven more by cognitive than by sensory factors, that is, these participants possibly
focus more on image content than on artistic composition. It will be of interest to study the
differences between such groups of participants in future research in more detail.
Limitations
In the presented study, we used images of oil paintings as stimuli and, therefore, we did not
show real (original) artworks but representations of artworks. This difference may have an
effect on the hedonic ratings (Brieber, Leder, & Nadal, 2015). Furthermore, the JenAesthetics
database consists of a preselected group of high-quality oil paintings. Hence, the database
includes a large proportion of images of rather similar quality. Any differences in aesthetic
ratings of these images may be relatively small, and therefore the aesthetic ratings may be
rather stable across art styles and content matter. In addition, the analysis of ratings on
aesthetics and beauty strongly depends from a proper understanding of these terms by the
participants. If participants understood the terms wrongly, the conclusions drawn would be
impaired.
Conclusion
The analysis did not reveal evidence for universal image properties that are systematically
linked to a higher aesthetic value in our sample of high-quality paintings. Instead, paintings
from every art period show specific patterns of SIPs. As an exception, art portraits possess
similar values of Self-Similarity over art periods. In an analysis of subjective rating scores, we
found differences of ratings on artistic value (aesthetics) and individual liking (beauty). These
differences in ratings were linked to SIPs, to the art period and to the time of origin of the
paintings. Last but not least, we showed that groups of participants varied systematically in
their hedonic preferences.
In summary, our study provides evidence that, to some extent, SIPs vary between art
periods and subject matters and, in addition, they can be correlated with the subjective
evaluation of paintings in a majority of the participants.
