Article
In a recently published book, ten Brinke and Porter (2013)
describe considerable research indicating that people in gen-
eral are rather bad at detecting lies, with most rating little
better than chance at detecting deception. Distressingly,
research also indicates that police officers and trial court
judges, those society has entrusted with the job of dispensing
justice, may be no better at detecting deception than the aver-
age person. For example, research relates that police officers
are actually trained to focus on signs of nervousness, statisti-
cally one of the weakest predictors of deception. In their pub-
lished work, ten Brinke and Porter cite research indicating
that judges and jurors, as well as people in general, are actu-
ally less likely to attribute deceit to attractive rather than
unattractive persons. In all, this research leads us to believe
that people are just lousy at catching liars and at least part of
the reason is that most of us focus on the wrong overt
behaviors.
While some lies can be innocuous, even benign, depend-
ing on the vulnerability of the person and the seriousness of
the situation, some lies can have devastating even deadly
results. This is obviously true in police investigations as well
as criminal trials. It is also true, however, that a forensic eval-
uation, on which the court relies to make its decisions, can be
completely wrong in the assessment of client dangerousness
and thereby have terrible consequences for the community
into which the client/defendant is returned. It is no wonder
that the perceived sincerity or honesty of other people is
often indicated as the single most desirable personality trait.
The ability to correctly identify truthful versus deceitful per-
sons represents an important social-cognitive skill with
seemingly obvious adaptive implications. Within the context
of judicial proceedings or court-ordered forensic psychologi-
cal evaluations, this is doubly true.

Attributes of Truthful Versus Deceitful
Statements in the Evaluation of Accused
Child Molesters
Shawn Johnston1, Alexis Candelier1, Dana Powers-Green1, and
Syeda Rahmani1
Abstract
The ability to detect deception, in everyday social interactions and psychological evaluations, can literally mean the difference
between life and death. Beyond physiological and nonverbal techniques for detecting deception, research has focused on
criteria designed to evaluate the content of verbal statements to distinguish between true or actually experienced events
versus internally manufactured or fabricated events. Criteria from two techniques that have received empirical support,
criteria-based content analysis and reality monitoring, were used to create an 11-item Deception Detection Checklist
(DDCL). In this study, 130 college undergraduates used the DDCL to rate the exculpatory statements of two accused
child molesters: one truthful, the other untruthful. The 11 items composing the DDCL, as well as a measure of perceived
truthfulness, were all scored on 7-point Likert-type scales. Nine of the 11 items on the DDCL significantly differentiated
between the true and untrue statements in the predicted direction. Overall scores on the DDCL indicated that the false
statement was rated as significantly more deceptive than the true statement. The DDCL possessed good reliability, and a
series of factor analyses provided strong support for the construct validity of the measure. The 7 psychometrically strongest
items from the DDCL included variables assessing the extent to which statements included clarity of detail, spatial details,
temporal details, and contextual details, as well as the relevance, reconstructability, and realism of the statement. These
results indicate that subjects were able to use this measure to reliably differentiate between true and false statements made
by accused child molesters.

Literature Review
Most research on deception detection has focused on the
assessment of physiological or nonverbal responses, com-
monly referred to as body language. For example, the fact
that many people exhibit autonomic nervous system
responses when they lie is the basis of the polygraph exami-
nation and the guilty knowledge test. Even more common
than that, probably every one of us has had the experience of
observing another person begin to sweat and breathe more
rapidly when he or she has begun to spin a lie. Sweating,
breathing heavily, excessive blinking, avoiding eye contact,
and general physical agitation all at least have some empiri-
cal support indicating that such behaviors, with some people,
in some situations, can indicate the attempt to deceive. While
physiological responses to telling lies is a well-documented
phenomenon, such responses have also been shown to occur
in reaction to embarrassment and other powerful emotions,
having nothing at all to do with deception.
Another approach to detecting deception derives from the
idea that true statements can be differentiated from false
statements as a function of the cognitive task or challenge
represented by attempting to deceive another person, a gen-
eral theory known as content complexity (ten Brinke &
Porter, 2013; Trivers, 2011) or cognitive load (Vrij, Mann, &
Fisher, 2006). From this theoretical perspective, the liar has
taken on a complicated and weighty cognitive chore by
attempting to deceive others. Not only must the liar make
certain to suppress his own knowledge of the truth, he also
needs to be relatively certain that the target of his deception
is unaware of that truth. Beyond this, the liar is also required
to be on constant guard against making inconsistent or con-
tradictory statements that could reveal his deception. This
overextension of cognitive ability appears to be the reason
why liars tend to make shorter statements than truth tellers,
as well as, why they are more likely to pause excessively
while verbalizing their statements. We believe that the cogni-
tive load experienced by a deceitful accused child molester
would be especially challenging and they would exhibit mul-
tiple signs of this attempt to deceive. While there is some
empirical support for techniques using physiological and
nonverbal cues to differentiate between truthful and deceitful
statements, our review of the deception detection literature
suggests that systems based on verbal cues or information
may be more reliable.
With regard to the assessment of deception using verbal
cues, two techniques have been independently developed
and tested for differentiating between truthful and deceitful
statements. The first of these, criteria-based content analysis
(CBCA), was originally developed in Germany for assessing
the veracity of children claiming to have been sexually
abused (Roma, San Martini, Sabatello, Tatarelli, & Ferracuti,
2011; Vrij, 2008). The second technique, reality monitoring
(RM), was developed to help differentiate between the actual
and hallucinated experiences of schizophrenic individuals
(Johnson & Raye, 1981; Vrij, 2008). While the original goals
and foci of these two techniques could hardly have been
more different, rather interestingly, both of them fundamen-
tally revolve around the idea that descriptions of actual ver-
sus imagined or fabricated experiences will differ in
predictable ways. Events that we literally experience in the
real world will have significant external inputs, while events
generated or created in the imagination or mind's eye will
have primarily, if not exclusively, internal inputs. Both tech-
niques predict then that actual or real experiences versus
imagined or fabricated ones, when described verbally will
contain more and richer details, appear more plausible and
realistic, be imbedded in time, space and some social or
interpersonal context, and include perceptual and/or sensory
information, such as the speaker's experience of tempera-
ture, sound, smell, and taste. Johnston et al. (2013) reviewed
in detail the published research regarding specific criteria
from both techniques, which had been subjected to empirical
study with regard to their ability to differentiate between
truthful and untruthful statements, and found that both sys-
tems demonstrated the ability to differentiate between truth-
ful and untruthful statements to a significant degree (Vrij,
2008).
From the 19 criteria used in the CBCA and the 8 criteria
used in RM to distinguish truthful from untruthful state-
ments, 11 items were derived, which are believed to capture
the most important features, in particular, those concepts that
appear in both systems (see Figure 1). Item 1 assesses the
clarity of detail provided in a statement. Item 2 assesses the
presence of perceptual information (e.g., the experience of
temperature or taste). Item 3 assesses the presence of spatial
information, such as physical proximity of people and
objects. Item 4 assesses the presence of temporal informa-
tion, such as how events are connected in time. Item 5
assesses the expression of affect or emotion on the part of the
person making the statement. Item 6 assesses the reconstruc-
tability of the statement, particularly whether the information
provided is consistent, noncontradictory, and logically plau-
sible. Item 7 assesses how realistic the statement is. Item 8
assesses how self-serving the statement is. Item 9, which is
our manipulation check variable, not a part of the checklist
per se, assesses the overall perceived truthfulness of the
statement. Item 10 assesses the extent to which information
in the statement is embedded in an interpersonal or social
context. Item 11 assesses whether statements made by other
individuals are reproduced versus being paraphrased or
inferred by the person making the statement. And finally,
Item 12 assesses how relevant are the details provided in the
statement. Unlike the dichotomous rating systems used in
CBCA and RM, the 11 new items were designed to be rated
on a 7-point Likert-type scale, going from strongly disagree
to strongly agree, that the attribute, such as clarity of detail,
was present in the statement. The individual response scales
were expanded from 2 to 7 options to provide research sub-
jects with more finely differentiated alternatives and to
Johnston et al. 3
increase the reliability of the measure. It should also be noted
that all items are scored in the direction of their name, that is,
a higher score on the spatial information item means that
more spatial information was present in the statement.
Method
Independent Variable
The independent variable in this study consisted of two con-
ditions: an exculpatory statement made by an accused "truth-
ful" child molester and an exculpatory statement made by an
accused "untruthful" child molester. Both statements were
taken from the files of the senior author who has specialized
in the evaluation and treatment of accused and convicted
sexual offenders since 1980. The two alleged child molesters
were both referred for confidential psychological assessment
by their attorneys regarding issues such as sexual dangerous-
ness and probation suitability. The client statements focused
exclusively on the client's explanations of the charges against
him and why he believes that he had been falsely accused of
numerous sexual offenses against multiple children. Both
clients'statements were taken directly from the relevant clin-
ical interview notes for that client and were comparable in
length, clear, and relatively articulate. Beyond this, the single
most important reason for selecting these particular client
statements was the actual judicial outcomes in each of their
respective criminal cases. Here, it should be noted that
because it is impossible to absolutely know when a statement
is true or false, it is often the case in the deception detection
literature that a client statement is viewed as truthful when a
judge or jury has exonerated the client. Correspondingly, a
client statement is viewed as false when a judge or jury finds
the client guilty. Thus, the statement identified as truthful in
this research was made by an individual who was acquitted
on all counts by a jury in less than 2 hr, with numerous jurors
reported as saying that the defendant was obviously innocent
rather than simply not guilty. In contrast, the untruthful state-
ment was made by an individual who was convicted on all
counts by a jury within a comparable period of time. While
this is obviously an imperfect method for selecting truthful
versus untruthful statements, it is widely accepted in the
research literature concerning deception detection and does
contain the virtue of involving real people, accused of very
serious crimes, which were carefully evaluated by juries of
their peers.
In addition, three practicing forensic psychologists, with
approximately 90 years of experience between them, were
asked to review the statement of the untruthful accused child
molester. They were then asked whether they found the state-
ment truthful or untruthful and, if they believed that the state-
ment was untruthful, to rate how typical it was of untrue

statements by accused and convicted child molesters. All
three psychologists indicated they believed that the state-
ment was untrue and that the statement was, in their experi-
ence, typical of statements made by untruthful child
molesters.
Dependent Variable
As indicated above, 11 items were designed, inspired by the
research literature from CBCA and RM, to assess different
attributes or dimensions indicative of truthful versus untruth-
ful statements. The content of these items and their origins is
discussed in the literature review. We hypothesized that the
research subjects would rate the truthful statement signifi-
cantly higher on the items believed to be correlated with
truthfulness, that is, clarity of detail, presence of perceptual/
sensory information, realism of the statement, and so on.
However, for the item assessing the self-serving nature of the
statement, higher scores were hypothesized to be indicative
of greater deceitfulness.
The 11 items were then combined into a Deception
Detection Checklist (DDCL). The scores on the 10 DDCL
items indicating truthfulness had to be reversed, so overall
DDCL score would indicate greater deceptiveness. Overall
scores on the DDCL can vary from a low of 11, the number
of items, to a high of 77, seven times 11, which would indi-
cate the maximum possible deceptiveness on the scale. It
should be noted that a 12th item was included on the check-
list though it does not contribute to the overall checklist
scores. This item, also on a 7-point response scale, asks the
subject to rate the truthfulness of the two different state-
ments. Scores on this item, in part, represent an important
check on how successful we were in manipulating the inde-
pendent variable. We defined successful manipulation of the
independent variable, as subjects correctly rating the truthful
statement as truthful and the untruthful statement as
untruthful.
Participants
Subjects were 130 students from a large university in Oregon
enrolled in an undergraduate class in forensic psychology.
Procedures
During the last week of class, the student subjects in this
research were briefly described the 11 items from the DDCL
and the research from which they originate. As noted above,
these were students in an upper division forensic psychology
class and much of the school term had been given over to
discussion of sociopaths, sex offenders, and the reliable psy-
chological assessment of such client populations. While the
topic of deception had been touched on many times before in
this class, with regard, for example, to its threat to psycho-
logical testing and interviewing, this was the first discussion
of the specific 11 variables previous research suggested are
capable of differentiating between truthful and untruthful
statements. Approximately 10 min were necessary to explain
the DDCL items and the rating task with which the subjects
were about to be presented.
At this point, the questionnaire packets were handed out
to the subjects. The questionnaire first informed the subject
that their involvement in this research was entirely voluntary,
would have no effect on their grade in the class, and was, in
fact, completely confidential and anonymous; that is, no sub-
ject was asked for personal identifying information other
than age, gender, and major.
Subjects were then asked to read both statements and then
rate the two statements relative to the items on the checklist,
also provided to the subjects. Thus, all subjects who partici-
pated in the research, which appeared to be about 100% of
the members of the classes, rated both statements per the
questionnaire items. Subjects required approximately 15 min
to read the statements and complete the questionnaire. Upon
completion of the task, approximately half an hour was given
over to explaining the background and hypotheses of the
research while also soliciting subject reaction to the ques-
tionnaire, the rating task, and the goals of the research.
Overwhelmingly, the subject's responses to the task were
positive, indicating that the task was interesting and useful.
Results
The internal consistency reliability coefficient (Cronbach's
alpha) for the DDCL was computed at .80. The means and
standard deviations for the truthful and untruthful conditions
along with the t-test statistics for the DDCL, the 11 items that
compose it, and the one manipulation check variable are pre-
sented in Table 1. We would first bring the reader's attention
to the results regarding the manipulation check variable, as
these results pertain to what extent we were successful in
having the subjects perceive the truthful statement as true
and the untruthful statement as untrue. If the subjects failed
to perceive any difference in truthfulness between the true
and untrue statements, it would be difficult to argue that
scores on the DDCL differed as a function of the statements
being true or untrue. To the extent that the subjects perceived
a significant difference between the two statements in terms
of truthfulness, differences observed between scores on the
other 11 items can reasonably be assumed to be directly con-
nected to the overall perception of the statement's
truthfulness.
The results of the manipulation check variable indicate a
very significant difference in the perceived truthfulness of
the truthful versus untruthful statements. Indeed of all the t
tests performed, the largest t-test statistic and greatest degree
of significant difference was found between subject's overall
ratings of the truthfulness of the truthful versus untruthful
statements. These results indicate our success in providing
two different statements to subjects, which they readily
Johnston et al. 5
distinguished as truthful versus untruthful (see Table 1 for
t-test statistics).
Next, we would like to bring the reader's attention to the
pattern of means and standard deviations presented in Table 1.
As indicated above, all the 11 items composing the DDCL as
well as the manipulation check item were rated by subjects on
7-point scales. Whether the individual item scales were uni-
polar, going from none of the attributes to a maximum of it,
or bipolar, going from the extreme of untruthfulness to its
opposite of total truthfulness, the score of 4 represents the
midpoint of every item scale. Thus, mean scores below 4
would indicate untruthfulness, whereas mean scores above 4
would indicate truthfulness. The potential importance of this
point is that it permits us to indicate not only whether an item
is able to differentiate between levels of truthfulness but also
whether that item is able to differentiate between truthfulness
and untruthfulness per se. We believe that it is important for
the mean scores on individual items in the truthful and
untruthful conditions to fall on opposite sides of their respec-
tive scale midpoints because we are interested in not just the
assessment of truthfulness along a continuum but categori-
cally as well.
With regard to the 11 items composing the DDCL, sub-
ject's ratings differed significantly in the predicted direction
in all but 2 of the items (expression of affect and self-serving
statements). Importantly, 7 of the 11 items exhibited both
significantly different ratings between conditions as well as
containing mean scores for the untruthful statement on oppo-
site sides of the item scale midpoint than the mean scores for
the truthful statement. These seven variables included clarity
of detail, spatial information, temporal information, recon-
structability of the statement, realism of the statement, con-
textual information, and relevance of the details provided in
the statement. In addition, 2 of the items, perceptual detail
and reproduction of conversation, yielded significant differ-
ences between the truthful and untruthful statements, but the
mean scores for both conditions were on the same side of the
item scale midpoints.
In addition to examining the ability of the items to differ-
entiate between the true and untrue statements, we thought it
would be interesting to see how each of the 11 items corre-
lated with both the DDCL overall score and our measure of
perceived truthfulness. We assumed that some of the items,
especially those assessing the realism of the statement, would
be more strongly associated with perceived truthfulness than
other items such as temporal or spatial details. The percep-
tion of how realistic a statement is appears to go to the heart
of whether it is perceived as truthful. In addition, we were
also interested in the relationship between the DDCL overall
score and perceived truthfulness, in that, both these variables
represent different approaches to the assessment of truthful-
ness: one directly, by simply asking the subject how truthful
they believed the statement to be, and the other indirectly, by
computing an overall score composed of items believed to be
characteristic of truthfulness. Table 2 presents the correla-
tions between the 11 items and both the DDCL score and the
measure of perceived truthfulness. In addition, the direct cor-
relation between DDCL scores and perceived truthfulness is
also reported in Table 2.
For ease of reading Table 2, the perceived truthfulness
variable was scored in the negative direction, thus obviating
the need for plus or minus signs. With this in mind, the cor-
relation between perceived truthfulness and the DDCL is
rather strong (.57). Put another way, almost one third of the
variance in the perceived truthfulness of the statements is
accounted for by DDCL scores. Not surprisingly, the

individual items of the DDCL are, with one exception, more
strongly correlated with overall DDCL scores than the per-
ceived truthfulness variable. One would expect this given
that the overall DDCL score contains within it each of the 11
items with which it is being correlated. One would also
expect these correlations to be high if all the items from the
DDCL do, in fact, measure different aspects or dimensions of
truthfulness, an assumption to be specifically explored
below. Also not surprising, given the t-test results, is the poor
performance of the affect and self-serving variables with
regard to their correlations with both the DDCL and per-
ceived truthfulness. In all, for the most part, the DDCL items
had correlations about twice as strong with the DDCL as
with the measure of perceived truthfulness. All but one of
these correlations were statistically significant, suggesting
that both the direct and indirect approaches to assessing the
truthfulness of a statement have utility.
With regard to our expectations regarding the possible
differential pattern of correlations, we found it very interest-
ing that the realism variable was by far more strongly corre-
lated with perceived truthfulness relative to any other item
from the DDCL. Indeed, the realism variable was the only
one to be equally strongly correlated with both DDCL scores
and perceived truthfulness (r = .64). In all, with two con-
spicuous exceptions, the items from the DDCL significantly
differentiate different levels of truthfulness as well as reveal
a pattern of correlations between the overall DDCL scores
and perceived truthfulness, which is generally consistent
with expectation as well as being consistent with our clinical
and forensic experiences.
Next, we performed two series of factor analyses on our
data. The first set of factor analyses involved the 9 variables
capable of significantly differentiating between the true and
untrue statements in the predicted direction. Thus, the expres-
sion of affect and self-serving statements variables were
excluded from all further analyses. For the purpose of the
first factor analyses, we entered all 9 variables from both the
truthful and untruthful conditions, yielding a grand total of
18 variables on which the factor analysis was performed.
There were a number of reasons we felt this would be the
most appropriate approach for performing an exploratory
factor analysis. Specifically, entering all 18 variables into the
analysis affords us the opportunity to compare head on the
relative importance of our variables with regard to their abil-
ity to differentiate between truthful and untruthful state-
ments.Forexample,doallofthevariableshaveapproximately
the same strength of relationship with truthfulness versus
untruthfulness or is it possible that some variables are more
closely associated with ratings of the true or the untrue state-
ment? In this regard and with reference to the concept of
factorial validity, we were hoping that our variables would
yield a factor solution in which the factors clearly revolved
around the themes of truthfulness and untruthfulness. In all,
we believed that this factor analysis would speak directly to
the construct validity of our variables as measures of both
truthfulness and untruthfulness while suggesting possible
differential contributions to the identification of the true ver-
sus untrue statements on the part of individual items.
The first factor analysis yielded three components. The
first two factors clearly revolved around the themes of
untruthfulness versus truthfulness, while the third factor
accounted for a trivial amount of variance and was based
almost entirely on the single item of reproduction of conver-
sation. This was not especially surprising as this variable was
one of the weakest of the 11 items in our statistical tests of
significant differences between the conditions. Criteria asso-
ciated with factor manipulation indicated the appropriateness
of imposing a two-factor solution on our data (results are
presented in Table 3).
It should first be noted that every variable used to assess
the untruthful statement loaded on Factor 1, which for obvi-
ous reason we have chosen to call the Untruthful factor.

Similarly, every one of the variables used to assess the truth-
ful statement loaded on Factor 2, which we just as obviously
will refer to as the Truthful factor. As there are no significant
loadings on Factor 1 of items used to rate the true statement,
and no significant loadings on Factor 2 of items used to rate
the untrue statement (in fact, all of these factor loadings hov-
ered around 0), we have left these data out of the table.
We believe that these results are extremely interesting.
First, and as already alluded to, the two-factor solution con-
sists of Factor 1 containing only variables used to rate the
untruthful statement and Factor 2 containing only variables
used to rate the truthful statement. We have inferred then that
the underlying theme of Factor 1 is untruthfulness and the
underlying theme of Factor 2 truthfulness. We also believe
that it is interesting to note the "purity" of the factors in that
the nine variables contributing to the analysis are very differ-
ent in content. While spatial and temporal information intui-
tivelyseemsconnected,justlikerealismandreconstructability,
the first two variables do not appear to have any obvious
connection with the latter two. In other words, it seems clear
from the factor analytic findings that the most powerful
underlying theme in the data is in fact the truthfulness versus
untruthfulness of the statements rated by our subjects.
It also bears noting that with one exception, the reproduc-
tion of conversation variable in the untruthful condition,
every factor loading is between 0.6 and 0.8. While this is not
surprising as in the three-factor solution, reproduction of
conversation essentially generated and accounted for the
third factor, it does suggest that otherwise all of our variables
contribute more or less about the same to the respective fac-
tors on which they load. Indeed with the one exception of the
reproduction of conversation variable, not one of the other
eight variables differed more than 0.1 from the truthful to
untruthful conditions. In other words, no obvious difference
was observed in any of these eight variables whether they
were being used to assess the true or untrue statement. With
the exception of the reproduction of conversation variable,
not one other variable appears to have been differentially
connected to the factor on which it loaded. Thus, clarity of
information was approximately as important in assessing an
untruthful statement as it was in assessing a truthful state-
ment, and none of these eight variables was conspicuously
more important in its association with truthfulness versus
untruthfulness. While the eight variables differ with regard to
their factor loadings, going from 0.6 to 0.8, a difference
which itself represents a comparatively small range, the con-
nection between the individual variables and the factors on
which they load is roughly equivalent. In terms of the con-
cept of factorial validity, these data appear particularly
encouraging.
Our final series of analyses involved performing two fac-
tor analyses: one on the items used to rate the truthful state-
ment and the other on the items used to rate the untruthful
statement. For these two analyses, we used only those items
that were found to be significantly different in the predicted
direction and whose item means fell on opposite sides of the
scale midpoints in their ratings of the truthful versus untruth-
ful statements. Thus, each of these seven items were capable

of significantly distinguishing the true from untrue statement
and did so in such a way as to indicate that the untruthful
statement was false and the truthful statement was true. As
discussed earlier, these seven items could be considered,
psychometrically, our best variables as they not only distin-
guish different levels of truthfulness but can actually be used
to distinguish between untruthful and truthful statements, per
se. Beyond this, we also believed that conducting a factor
analysis using these items in the truthful versus untruthful
statement conditions would provide us with a direct opportu-
nity to explore the possibility that the different variables may
have differential relationships or connections with true ver-
sus untrue statements. While the results reported in Table 3
indicate that these seven variables are more or less equally
associated with the assessment of truthful versus untruthful
statements, it is definitely possible that the seven different
variables may be relatively stronger or weaker in rating the
truthfulness of a statement depending on whether the state-
ment is true or false. In other words, it seemed likely that our
variables would be differentially sensitive or important with
regard to the dimension of truthfulness versus
untruthfulness.
For example, as described above we believed that the
variable of realism would be especially important in assess-
ing whether a statement is true or untrue. By performing two
factor analyses, one based on the variables used to rate the
truthful statement and the other based on variables used to
rate the untruthful statement, this would seem to afford the
most direct opportunity to compare head on the importance
of our seven best variables in assessing true versus false
statements (results are presented in Table 4). The left side of
Table 4 presents the results of the factor analysis on the items
rating the truthful statement and the right side of the table
presents the results of the factor analysis on the items rating
the untruthful statement. We should note here that we
expected this factor analysis would reveal some different
relationships between the items and anticipated factors.
Specifically, we reasoned that the variables connected with
situational information, such as the spatial, temporal, contex-
tual, and clarity of details, might generate their own factor
given what seems to be the obvious conceptual connection
between these items. Similarly, we reasoned that the
reconstructability, realism and relevance of details, variables
would be likely to form their own factor as these items also
appear connected by a value judgment concerning the quality
of the information in the statement. Candidly, we also
expected that these latter three variables, especially realism
and reconstructability, would prove relatively stronger than
the situational variables in explaining the extracted factors as
these three variables reflected judgments of the statement
that seemed to directly overlap with the concept of truthful-
ness. Thus, while the presence of situational attributes is
important in determining whether someone is speaking the
truth, we reasoned that realism, reconstructability, and the
relevance of what was said would be of primary importance
in identifying truthful versus untruthful statements. We were,
therefore, frankly surprised, albeit pleasantly so, to see that
the two factor analyses yielded solutions composed of only
one factor each. The factor analysis on the seven items used
to rate the true statement created one factor only as did the
factor analysis on the seven items used to rate the untrue
statement.
Examination of the data presented in Table 4 indicates
that our expectations regarding items differentially contrib-
uting to the factors received only very partial support. Indeed
for the factor analysis on the truthful condition items, every
one of the first four variables dealt with what we just
described as situational details, while the three variables with
the lowest loading were our so-called judgment variables.
However, we do find it interesting to note that the single
strongest item factor correlation for the untruthful condition
is for the reconstructability variable even though realism and
relevance remain more or less at the bottom of the list. It
should of course be noted that the single-factor solutions for
these two analyses speak directly to the construct validity of
our measurement, indicating that each and every one of these
seven variables does very well with regard to the assessment
of both true and untrue statements. It also bears noting that
the entire item factor loading in both analyses was relatively
quite high with no loading falling below 0.6. Finally, it
should be noted that more than 50% of the variance of the
data was accounted for in both factor solutions. If we were
going to be disappointed in our results, it is difficult to imag-
ine a more pleasing disappointment.

Discussion
While the deception detection literature indicates that people
are generally rather bad at catching liars, apparently most
people assume that what others tell them is generally true,
the subjects in our study appear to have exhibited a lie bias.
Our results reveal that the untruthful statement was perceived
as more deceptive than the truthful statement was perceived
as true. In addition, the untruthful statement was rated as
more deceptive with regard to overall DDCL scores than the
truthful statement was rated as true on this same measure. A
lie bias is hardly surprising, given that our subjects were
upper division college students in a forensic psychology
class assessing the statements of two men formally accused
of child molestation. Even though it would seem desirable to
have neither a truth nor lie bias, we have the sense that in
forensic psychological evaluations where the stakes can
include incarceration and/or the loss or gain of considerable
amounts of money, a cautious, even wary, attitude on the part
of the examiner may be a good thing. We also interpret these
data positively in that they suggest, consistent with other
research (ten Brinke & Porter, 2013), that empirically based
techniques designed to detect deception can be taught.
Beyond this, we believe that the foremost implication of
our results is in demonstrating that the truthfulness of a state-
ment, at least in some situations, can be identified with a high
level of reliability and internal validity. Clearly, the most
conspicuous limitation of the present research is the fact that
subjects rated only two statements, both pertaining to
extreme and extraordinary situations. It will not be possible
to make any serious claims regarding the external validity or
generalizability of our measure until such time as it has been
applied to the assessment of a greater variety of statements.
Needless to say, the focus of future research would be to find
out whether our measure, particularly the seven best items, is
as reliable and significant in differentiating the truthfulness
of client statements in a variety of other settings. While these
items demonstrated the ability to differentiate between levels
of truthfulness of accused sex offenders, it would be interest-
ing to know whether they could do the same with regard to
differentiating between clients actually suffering from rather
than feigning mental illness.
While our subject's ratings of the perceived truthfulness
of the two statements were strongly associated with overall
DDCL scores, the two measures are clearly not the same
thing and approach the assessment of truthfulness in funda-
mentally different ways. Asking a subject to specifically rate
the truthfulness of a statement represents as direct an assess-
ment of truthfulness as one can imagine. However, of our
seven psychometrically best items from the DDCL, four of
them deal with aspects or attributes of a situation that have
no a priori or necessary connection with truthfulness, per se.
Why, for example, should information regarding spatial or
temporal detail be so strongly correlated with the perceived
truthfulness of a statement? While a clever sociopath could
include in his or her statement these kinds of details, the
robust nature of these variables speaks directly to the idea
that true rather than internally manufactured experiences will
include such "real world" information. Thus, while a knowl-
edgeable sociopath could include such information in a false
statement, it seems obvious that it would require consider-
able intellectual even scientific sophistication as well as sub-
stantial forethought and cognitive rehearsal.
In contrast, variables, such as relevance, realism, and
reconstructability, which reflect judgments regarding a state-
ment, seem to have a different relationship to the assessment
of truthfulness, than situational attributes, such as spatial and
temporal details. We believe that the relatively high correla-
tion between realism and perceived truthfulness is illustra-
tive of a uniquely important relationship between these
variables. Of the many hundreds of psychological evalua-
tions the senior author has performed on accused and con-
victed child molesters, it is striking how often the defendant's
version of the events which led to the criminal charges
against him would seem unbelievable, if not outright absurd.
It is entirely common for many of these men to claim that the
primary reason they were being falsely accused of child sex-
ual abuse was that they were, in some important way, too
nice, too generous, too caring, and too concerned regarding
the victim and the victim's family. While it is painfully
apparent that innocent persons are at times falsely accused of
serious crimes, in the real world, it is vanishingly rare for a
child or children and their families to conspire together
against a man, to falsely accuse him of molestation, just
because that man had just been too kind or generous toward
that family. The present results clearly suggest how critical to
the assessment of truthfulness we believe the realism of the
statement can be. It is our impression that when statements
are conspicuously unrealistic, the probable assessment of
deception dramatically increases.
However, while the correlational data and tests of signifi-
cance indicate the importance of realism to the evaluation of
truthfulness, the factor analyses of our best seven items sug-
gest a rather different perspective. If one accepts at face
value the data presented in Table 4, realism is by no means
the most important variable in assessing a statement's truth-
fulness or untruthfulness. Indeed, the factor analysis on the
seven items in the truthful condition suggests that the four
situational variables, clarity, temporal, spatial, and contex-
tual detail, are all more important in the assessment of truth-
fulness than the three judgment variables, relevance, realism,
and reconstructability (i.e., the four situational variables load
more highly on the one extracted factor). These data suggest
that the foremost hallmark of a true statement could be the
mundane even trifling little situational details included in it.
Such factual details which have little or no meaning in and of
themselves, when included in a person's statement may be
emblematic of truth.
In addition, we find it equally interesting that in the factor
analysis for the seven items in the untruthful condition, the
10 SAGE Open
reconstructability variable has the single highest correlation
with the untruthful factor. While realism remains relatively
low in this factor analysis, reconstructability and realism still
represent judgments about a statement that are conceptually
related. Realism is fundamentally about the believability of a
statement, while reconstructability refers to its plausibility and
logical coherence. So in contrast to the assessment of truthful
statements, our data suggest that the evaluation of untrue state-
ments may have less to do with the situational attributes than
with the judgment that the statement is just too inconsistent,
too contradictory, and too implausible to be possible.
Rather than risking further over interpretation of our
results, the most important point, in our opinion, is the fact
that the 2 seven-item factor analyses both yielded single-fac-
tor solutions. As conceptually different as spatial information
is from the judgment of the realism, all seven items in both
conditions yielded single-factor solutions, indicating that
these seven items are all measuring the same thing and are
connected in some underlying fashion. Obviously, it is our
belief that the theme underlying the factor analytic data is the
truthfulness versus untruthfulness of the statements being
evaluated. While we have yet to demonstrate the generaliz-
ability of our measure, its reliability and internal validity with
regard to the present data seem clear. Our hope is to do further
research on our seven best items to assess the extent to which
they possess external as well as internal validity.
