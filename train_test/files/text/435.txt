Abstract Although genetic and environmental factors are
separately implicated in the development of antisocial
behavior (ASB), interactive models have emerged relatively
recently, particularly those incorporating molecular genetic
data. Using a large sample of male Caucasian adolescents
and young adults from the National Longitudinal Study of
Adolescent Health (Add Health), the association of deviant
peer affiliation, the 30-base pair variable number tandem
repeat polymorphism in promoter region of the monoamine
oxidase-A (MAOA) gene, and their interaction, with
antisocial behavior (ASB) was investigated. Weighted
analyses accounting for over-sampling and clustering
within schools as well as controlling for age and wave
suggested that deviant peer affiliation and MAOA genotype
were each significantly associated with levels of overt ASB
across a 6-year period. Only deviant peer affiliation was
significantly related to covert ASB, however. Additionally,
there was evidence suggestive of a gene-environment
interaction (G × E) where the influence of deviant peer
affiliation on overt ASB was significantly stronger among
individuals with the high-activity MAOA genotype than the
low-activity genotype. MAOA was not significantly asso-
ciated with deviant peer affiliation, thus strengthening the
inference of G × E rather than gene-environment correlation
(rGE). Different forms of gene-environment interplay and
implications for future research on ASB are discussed.

Antisocial behavior (ASB) consists of a diverse constellation
of behaviors including violence and aggression, violating the
rights/property of others, and breaking age-appropriate rules
and norms (e.g., truancy). ASB is frequently persistent,
resistant to treatment, and reliably associated with negative
outcomes, including comorbidity (e.g., substance depen-
dence, antisocial personality disorder), poor academic
achievement, negative social relationships, and occupational
instability (Loeber et al. 1998; Hinshaw and Lee 2003). The
stability of overt/physical ASB across the lifespan
approaches IQ, long considered one of the most stable
individual attributes (Loeber and Stouthamer-Loeber 1998).
Moreover, impairment related to ASB and externalizing
behavior more broadly has historically constituted the most
common referral for mental health services for American
youth (Achenbach and Howell 1993; Kazdin 1995). Thus,
ASB constitutes a significant public health problem and it
remains an important scientific priority.
Broad characterizations of ASB, however, may betray
important differences with respect to patterns of associa-
tion, predictive validity, and etiological influences. A meta-
analysis determined that two dimensions, consisting of
overt and covert as well as destructive and non-destructive,
described the underlying architecture of ASB (Frick et al.
1993). Using multi-method (i.e., laboratory, naturalistic
observations) strategies of ASB assessment in school-aged
boys, Hinshaw et al. (1995) found that covert ASB was
independent of overt aggression and that covert ASB
demonstrated discriminant and covergent validity with
other constructs (i.e., attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder
(ADHD), child behavior problems). Indeed, the distinction
between overt and covert ASB is evident early in
development and persists through adolescence and young
adulthood. Willoughby et al. (2001) found that overt
aggression uniquely predicted other problems (e.g., class-

room conflict, hyperactivity) relative to covert ASB. Next,
a laboratory measure of childhood covert ASB significantly
predicted adolescent psychopathology in two independent
samples of boys and girls, controlling for overt aggression,
ADHD, and peer rejection (Lee and Hinshaw 2004, 2006).
Using latent class analysis (LCA) in a large study of
adolescents and youth adults, covert ASB was empirically
distinct from overt ASB, including patterns of sex differ-
ences in overt and covert ASB that were consistent with
prevailing theories (Li and Lee 2010). Finally, overt and
covert ASB are separable with respect to genetic influences.
Burt (2009) meta-analyzed twin studies and found that
overt ASB was more heritable than covert ASB and that
shared environmental influences were more salient for
covert ASB than overt ASB. Finally, recent molecular
genetic studies, across multiple designs (e.g., prospective
longitudinal, clinical) and neurobiological systems (e.g.,
dopamine, serotonin) showed differential effects for overt
vs. covert ASB (Li and Lee 2010; Monuteaux et al. 2009).
Overall, overt versus covert ASB is a meaningful distinc-
tion and one that should be prioritized in future studies,
particularly genetic association studies which have largely
ignored the distinction.
Deviant peer affiliation is a strong predictor of ASB
from childhood through adolescence and early adulthood,
across naturalistic and intervention designs (Dodge et al.
2006; Dishion and Patterson 2006). Deviant peer affiliation
positively predicted childhood- and adolescent-onset trajec-
tories of ASB, controlling for initial ASB, suggesting its
centrality in the emergence, maintenance, and escalation of
ASB over time (Gordon et al. 2004; LaCourse et al. 2006).
Among 267 boys and girls entering kindergarten, deviant
peer affiliation significantly predicted overt and covert
conduct problems across home, school, and playground
contexts (Snyder et al. 2005). Similarly, Monahan et al.
(2009) demonstrated that deviant peer association prospec-
tively predicted ASB in a sample of 1,354 youth (ages 14 to
22) with incarceration histories. Finally, Fergusson et al.
(2002) reported that among 1,265 children, followed
prospectively into young adulthood, deviant peer affiliation
predicted diverse negative outcomes (i.e., substance prob-
lems, violence, property crime), although the magnitude of
the association was stronger in adolescents (14­15 years-
old) than young adults (20­21 years-old). Thus, deviant
peer affiliation is a risk factor for ASB and these influences
have been suggested across development.
Despite the persuasive evidence on the association of
deviant peer affiliation and ASB, not all youth with deviant
peers engage in ASB or equally affected by deviant peers.
In a study of 6th grade children followed prospectively into
adolescence, individual differences in effortful and inhibi-
tory control moderated the influence of deviant peer
affiliation on ASB. Specifically, deviant peer affiliation
significantly predicted ASB only among the subgroup of
youth with poor self-regulation. Among youth with well-
developed self-regulation, deviant peer affiliation did not
predict ASB (Gardner et al. 2004). In a prospective study of
school-aged children, age 14 deviant peer affiliation
significantly predicted age 16 ASB even when age 14
ASB was controlled. However, adolescents with heightened
reward sensitivity were particularly susceptible to peer
deviance (Goodnight et al. 2006). Other studies suggest
individual differences in response inhibition, coupled with
deviant peer affiliation, may be particularly predictive of
ASB (Kendler et al. 2008) whereas youth with a positive
emotional attachment to their parents prospectively reported
lower levels of ASB in the presence of deviant peer
affiliation (Vitaro et al. 2000). Given that all youth are not
equally susceptible to deviant peer influences, there is a
need to identify moderators of deviant peer effects on ASB.
The detection of subgroups of youth who may be
particularly vulnerable to deviant peers may benefit from
targeted intervention and prevention efforts.
One important class of moderators that has yet to be
thoroughly explored is genetic liability. Genetic susceptibility
may provide additional traction on the conditions in which
deviant peer affiliation predicts ASB. Among 359 6 year-old
twins, deviant peer affiliation and genetic risk (defined by the
co-twin's aggression and the pair's zygosity) were each
independently associated with aggression. However, the
influence of deviant peers was significantly stronger among
genetically vulnerable children, suggesting a gene­environ-
ment interaction (G × E) (van Lier et al. 2007). Similarly, in a
study of 406 7 year-old twins (Brendgen et al. 2008),
variability in physical aggression was significantly explained
by the interaction between friends' aggression and child
genetic vulnerability (based on zygosity and co-twin's
aggression). Importantly, the putative G × E was not
significant for social aggression, suggesting that G × E
effects may be specific to physical aggression (e.g., social
aggression is more strongly correlated with popularity and
prosocial attention) (Brendgen et al. 2008) and different
forms of ASB more generally (e.g., proactive vs. reactive
aggression). These studies collectively underscore the
plausibility that genetic factors change the nature of deviant
peer affiliation influences on ASB and the importance of
specifying subtypes of ASB.
However, the mechanisms mediating deviant peer
affiliation and ASB have not been ascertained. Deviant
peer affiliation may provide an ideal context to engage in
ASB because of positive reinforcement (i.e., peer approval)
and modeling or genetic mediation. Kendler et al. (2007)
uncovered genetic effects on peer group deviance (Kendler
et al. 2007) and a population-based study estimated that
64% of adolescents' exposure to peers who smoke or drank
was genetically influenced (Cleveland et al. 2005). Passive,

evocative, and active gene­environment correlations (rGE)
raise the possibility that deviant peer affiliation effects and
ASB may be partially explained by genetic effects (Jaffee
and Price 2007; Monahan et al. 2009). Thus, latent genetic
factors covarying with aspects of the environment suggest
that molecular genetic assays constitute an important
direction for future research.
Despite the value of traditional behavior genetic designs,
they are anonymous in that they do not identify specific
genetic variants, therefore preventing inferences about the
underlying biology regulated by genetic variation. However,
molecular genetic assays directly test genomic variation and
once they are replicated, they provide a strong empirical basis
to explore the neurobiological consequences of genetic
differences (e.g., neural recruitment/activation). One strong
candidate for ASB is the monoamine oxidase-A gene
(MAOA) given that the enzyme associated with this gene
plays a significant role in the catabolism of synaptic catechol-
amines such as dopamine, serotonin, and norepinepherine.
The MAOA gene has been mapped to chromosome Xp11.23­
Xp11.4 (Ozelius et al. 1988). In particular, the 30-base pair
(bp) variable number tandem repeat (VNTR) polymorphism
in the promoter region of MAOA has garnered significant
interest because long repeat sequences of this functional
polymorphism result in greater transcriptional efficiency than
short repeat sequences (Sabol et al. 1998). Based on
evidence from transgenic mice models (Cases et al. 1995)
and from a carefully characterized simplex family of affected
males and carriers with a point mutation in the MAOA gene
(Brunner et al. 1993), monoamine may be particularly salient
for ASB and related phenotypes.
Studies of MAOA and ASB have been inconsistent,
however. In a sample of nearly 1,000 7 year-old children,
low-activity MAOA genotypes significantly predicted
ASB, ADHD, and an aggregate measure of mental health
problems, but they were unrelated to emotional problems
(Kim-Cohen et al. 2006). Main effects for the high-activity
MAOA genotype and aggression were reported in a small
sample of psychiatrically-referred boys (mean=9.2 years)
(Beitchman et al. 2004). Null findings for MAOA and ASB
were reported among 247 adolescent boys (12­18 years)
referred for intensive day or residential treatment (Young et
al. 2006). In a sample of 277 11­15 year-old Caucasian
boys, Huizinga et al. (2006) found no association of
MAOA and ASB (e.g., conduct disorder (CD), arrests for
violence). And finally, based on 774 Caucasian adolescents
and young adults from the National Longitudinal Study of
Adolescent Health, MAOA was unrelated to self-reported
ASB (Haberstick et al. 2005). It is important to note that all
of these studies were cross-sectional, with the exception of
Haberstick et al. (2005), who collapsed multi-occasion
measures of ASB into a single composite. This is a
limitation given that age-related changes in ASB are
reliable and they may misrepresent differences in underly-
ing mechanisms and prognosis (Hinshaw and Lee 2003).
Lahey et al. (2002) demonstrated that boys with persistent
conduct disorder (CD) had the highest levels of comorbid
anxiety, depression, ADHD, and oppositional defiant
disorder (ODD) than youth with less stable CD. Similarly,
more than 90% of 7­15 year-old girls had an age of onset
for CD prior to age 10, with a single common pathway to
CD consisting of the intensification of symptoms first
evident in childhood rather than an abrupt onset in
adolescence (Keenan et al. 2010). Thus, prospective
longitudinal studies are necessary to delineate unique
pathways and patterns of association.
In addition to psychopathology, MAOA variants are
significantly related to potential endophenotypes for ASB
(i.e., intermediate phenotypes between etiology and explicit
behavior) (Gottesman and Gould 2003). For example, the
30-base pair (bp) VNTR in the promoter region of MAOA
was significantly associated with personality traits relevant to
ASB (i.e., harm avoidance, reward dependence) (Buckholtz
et al. 2008) and brain MAOA activity measured in vivo was
associated with trait measures of aggression (Alia-Klein et
al. 2008). In addition to main effects, MAOA has been
implicated in interactive models for ASB across social
environments. Among rhesus monkeys, the influence of
rearing experiences on measures of aggression was stronger
among monkeys with the low-activity 7-repeat allele of the
MAOA genotype (Karere et al. 2009). Levels of adolescent
and adult ASB among children with severe exposure to
maltreatment were significantly higher in individuals with
the low-activity MAOA genotypes (i.e., 3-repeat and 5-
repeat) versus high-activity genotypes (i.e., 3.5- and 4-
repeat) differed by MAOA genotype (Caspi et al. 2002).
Subsequent validation using meta-analysis with low-activity
MAOA genotypes defined as 2-, 3-, and 5-repeat alleles has
also been reported (Kim-Cohen et al. 2006). MAOA
genotype also moderated the teratogenic consequences of
prenatal exposure to nicotine where boys with the low-
activity MAOA genotypes (i.e., 3-, 5-repeat) and girls with
the high-activity MAOA genotypes (i.e., 3.5-, 4-repeat)
exhibiting more adolescent CD than youth with different
genotypes (Wakschlag et al. 2010).
Although the precise explanatory factors for MAOA
increasing susceptibility to negative environments are
unknown, MAOA genotype has been implicated in the
`socioaffective scaffold' that regulates social evaluation,
decision-making, and emotion regulation. That is, individ-
uals with particular genotypes possess compromised "neu-
ral equipment" (p. 127) that sensitizes them to negative
social and interpersonal experiences that propel the devel-
opment of ASB (and aggressive forms in particular)
(Buckholtz and Meyer-Lindenberg 2008). Thus, in the
context of deviant peer affiliation, individuals with the low-
J Abnorm Child Psychol (2011) 39:321­332 323
activity MAOA genotype may be differentially sensitive to
the deviant peer effects, given disruptions to socio-
emotional functioning, particularly with respect to decision
making in a social context. Together with evidence that
adolescent-limited offenders, whose ASB is less heritable,
largely covert (i.e., status offenses), and driven substantially
by peer networks (Moffitt et al. 2001), overt ASB should be
more sensitive to MAOA variation than covert ASB. To test
the specificity of MAOA and its association with aggres-
sion and violence (Buckholtz and Meyer-Lindenberg 2008),
studies must separately assess overt and covert ASB.
Collectively, these studies suggest that the low-activity
MAOA genotype is a plausible candidate gene for ASB
(and overt ASB specifically), particularly in the context of
interactions with variation in negative social experiences,
including deviant peer affiliation.
Overall, there are three important features of this study that
collectively represent an advance over previous studies. First,
this sample consists of adolescents and adults prospectively
followed across approximately six years. This approach is
necessary to explore the discriminant validity of behaviorally
defined syndromes and disorders (Eley, Lichtenstein, and
Moffitt 2003) and it is consistent with recommendations in
the area of G × E for peer influences and aggression (van
Lier et al. 2007; Brendgen et al. 2008). This is also important
given that repeated measures designs improve the precision
of phenotype measurement and thereby enhance statistical
power (Schmitz et al. 1998), a longstanding challenge in the
genetic epidemiology of complex phenotypes (Risch and
Merikangas 1996). Second, unlike previous studies that were
limited to the anonymous approach of traditional behavior
genetic studies, this study tested the contribution of MAO-A
genotype, a functional variant affecting neural activation and
sensitivity to environments. Third, this study simultaneously
integrated a developmentally-informative and genetically-
sensitive design with separate measures of overt and covert
ASB in a largely adolescent sample, given that overt and
covert ASB possess unique patterns of association with other
domains of influence (e.g., heritability, family factors).
Although this is not a representative sample, the
participants were not clinic-referred, thereby avoiding the
biases of such samples, including high comorbidity and
early onset of problems and impairment (Goodman et al.
1997). To review, the goal of the study was two-fold: (1) To
test the independent association of deviant peer affiliation
and MAOA genotype on self-reported ASB collected
prospectively across three separate assessments in adoles-
cence and early adulthood; and (2) To test MAOA as a
potential moderator of deviant peer affiliation effects on
overt and covert ASB. Based on the extant literature, we
hypothesize that deviant peer affiliation will positively
predict overt and covert ASB whereas MAOA genotype
(i.e., low-activity polymorphisms) will positively predict
overt ASB only. Furthermore, we expect that the effects of
deviant peer affiliation on ASB will be stronger in the low-
versus high-activity MAOA genotype (i.e., gene­environ-
ment interaction).
Method
Participants
The National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (Add
Health) ascertained a stratified random sample of youth from
U.S. high schools, with oversamples based on race-ethnicity.
In Wave I, 20,745 adolescents (grades 7­12, ages 12­20 years
during the 1994­1995 school year; 47.5% male) were
interviewed. One year later, in Wave II, approximately
15,000 of the same youth were assessed during in-home
interviews. Approximately 5 years later, an embedded genetic
sample, consisting of all full siblings and twins, was asked to
provide saliva for genetic analyses in Wave III (n=3,787).
The subjects at Wave III had a mean age of 22.4 years (SD=
1.7). Analyses were limited to Caucasian males to enhance
comparisons with existing studies of MAOA and ASB in the
literature (Caspi et al. 2002; Edwards et al. 2010; Foley et al.
2004). Because MAOA expression in women cannot be
unambiguously determined (Carrel and Willard 2005),
experts recommend that analyses of MAOA be limited to
men (Kim-Cohen et al. 2006). Analyses were conducted on
the 670, 631, and 672 youth with available data at Wave I,
II, and III, respectively. Demographic descriptions of the
sample are provided in Table 1.
These data are contractually available to certified researchers
and details are available at http://www.cpc.unc.edu/projects/

participate in the study. Unless otherwise directed by the
school, passive consent forms were utilized. In other words, it

was returned with a signature that indicated otherwise,
although some schools required active consent forms. Written
informed consent was obtained from the parent or legal
guardian and the adolescent for the in-home interviews.
Measures
Antisocial Behavior
At each of the three assessments, conducted during in-home
interviews, individuals reported the frequency of 10 types
of ASB, including fighting resulting in harm, group
fighting, assault with a weapon, vandalism, selling mari-
juana, breaking and entering, and stealing. Response
options for the ASB items were as follows: 0 (none), 1 or
2 times, 3 or 4 times, or 5+times. We summed the 10
behaviors at each assessment and analyzed the data as three
separate repeated measures. Standardized Cronbach alphas
were 0.89, 0.77, and 0.86 for the three ASB measures at
waves 1­3, respectively. Although these ASB items are not
directly derived from DSM-IV based inventories or inter-
views, they do share similar properties to CD including
separate measures of overt ASB (e.g., fighting) and covert
ASB (e.g., theft) and they refer to a similar period of time
(i.e., behavior in the previous 12 months).
Deviant Peer Affiliation
At Wave 1, youth were asked how many of their three closest
friends smoked at least one cigarette each day, smoked
marijuana at least 1 time each month, and drank alcohol at
least 1 time each month. Participants were also asked about
how often they took part in a fight where his/her group of
friends fought against another group of people (past
12 months). Based on an ordinal scale, participants indicated
whether they fought with their peers against other youth 0, 1­
2, 3­4, or more than 5 times. These four variables (smoking,
marijuana, alcohol, group violence) were standardized via z-
scores and then averaged to create an overall measure of
deviant peer affiliation. The standardized Cronbach alpha for
the composite measure was 0.64.
Genotyping
At Wave III, genomic DNA was isolated from buccal cells
using standard methods. MAOA genotype was assayed by
a minor modification of a published method. Primer
sequences for the 30 bp VNTR in the promoter region of
the MAOA were: forward, 5ACAGCCTGACCG-TGGA-
GAAG-3 (fluorescently labeled), and reverse, 5-
GAACGTGACGCTCCATTCGGA-3. Products of this
reaction included five possible fragment sizes that included
291, 321, 336, 351, and 381 bps. Genotypes were scored
independently by two individuals. Following the proce-
dures outlined previously (Edwards et al. 2010; Foley et al.
2004; Kim-Cohen et al. 2006), 336 (3.5-repeat) and 351 (4-
repeat) polymorphisms were coded into a high-activity
group (n=419) and 291 (2-repeat), 321 (3-repeat), and 381
(5-repeat) polymorphisms were coded into a low-activity
group (n=253). These groups are associated with more and
less transcriptional efficiency, respectively. The genotype
distribution was as follows: 291/291 (n=1), 321/321 (n=
238), 336/336 (n=7), 351/351 (n=412), and 381/381 (n=
14) (see Table 1 summarizing demographic and behavioral
characteristics of MAOA genotype groups).
Statistical Analyses
Weighted descriptive analyses were conducted to take cluster-
ing within schools, oversampling, and the complex survey
design into account. Tests of the association of genotype and
deviant peer affiliation with overt and covert ASB at each wave
were conducted using log-linear regression in generalized
estimating equations (GEE) in SAS GENMOD, specifying
Poisson distributions and an autoregressive correlation struc-
ture. GEE estimates change over time at the population level
rather than at the individual or cluster-specific level. Because
GEE estimate means in each assessment from available data,
they accommodate missing data well, especially when
retention is high, as in the present study. GEE is superior to
generalized linear models for several reasons (Hanley et al.
2003): (1) more reliable standard errors and improved
confidence intervals; (2) maximum flexibility to specify the
working correlation matrix (e.g., exchangeable, unstructured),
although auto-regressive is featured here given the clustered
nature of the observations over time; (3) even if the matrix is
misspecified, parameter estimates and variance estimators are
generally stable; and (4) the use of an empirical or robust
variance estimator is appropriate because one is typically
unaware of the correct covariance structure.
Youth with available genotype data did not differ in total
ASB from the youth in the Wave I sample who were not
genotyped [F(1,20311)=2.95, p=0.09, respectively], al-
though there were marginally fewer boys (47.8% vs.
52.2%), 2=3.45, p=0.06 and significantly fewer African
Americans (18% vs. 22.9%), 2=29.8, df=1, p<0.001 and
Hispanics among genotyped youth (12.2% vs. 17.3%), 2=
12.8, df=1, p<0.001 than in the overall sample. Because
MAOA genotypes were non-randomly distributed by race-
ethnicity (2=78.4, df=12, p<0.0001), a necessary condi-
tion for population stratification (Hutchison et al. 2004),
only data from Caucasian males were analyzed to avoid
spurious findings that are the result of allelic differences in
ancestral populations. Finally, to further characterize the
J Abnorm Child Psychol (2011) 39:321­332 325
sample of Caucasian males with MAOA genotypes featured
in these analyses against the overall genotyped sample,
comparisons on age and family income were conducted. No
significant differences were observed between the two
groups of youth for age (2 =4.84, df=8, p=0.78).
However, youth in the current study came from families
with significantly higher incomes than the remaining
genotyped sample (t(428)=4.28, p<0.0001). Although
family income was originally included as a covariate to
account for this difference, its inclusion did not meaning-
fully change the results presented below. Consequently, it
was not retained as a covariate.
Results
Overt ASB: MAOA Genotype, Deviant Peer Affiliation,
and their Interaction (G × E)
Total counts of ASB may betray disparate influences
underlying overt/aggressive and covert/non-aggressive
forms, including genetic influences and gene­environment
interplay (Burt 2009; Edelbrock et al. 1995). To ascertain
the specificity of deviant peer affiliation and MAOA
influences on diverse forms of ASB, generalized estimating
equations (GEE) were modeled separately for five overt
ASB items, controlling for age and wave (see Table 2,
Model 1 for a model summary of parameters for covariates
and main effects only). In the fully saturated model,
consisting of covariates (i.e., age and wave), main effects,
and the deviant peer affiliation × MAOA genotype
interaction term (see Table 2, Model 2), there was a
significant effect of MAOA genotype (=-0.56, z=-2.19,
p<0.05) and deviant peer affiliation (=1.26, z=2.28, p<
0.05). This suggests that individuals with the low-activity
MAOA genotype, which is associated with poor transcrip-
tional efficiency of monoamine, reported significantly more
overt ASB across 6 years than those in the high-activity
group. The adjusted means and standard errors for the
genotype groups for overt ASB were M=0.27, SE=0.11
and M=0.34, SE=0.16 for the high- and low-activity
groups, respectively (see Table 2, Model 2).
A potential gene­environment interaction (G × E) was
explored by testing whether the association of deviant
peer affiliation effects and ASB were moderated by
MAOA genotype. This model controlled for age and
wave, included the main effects for deviant peer
affiliation and MAOA genotype, and included a separate
interaction term. There was evidence consistent with a
deviant peer affiliation × MAOA interaction for overt
ASB (=1.57, z=2.67, p<0.01) (see Table 2, Model 2).
That is, deviant peer affiliation predicted overt ASB more
strongly among individuals with the high-activity MAOA
genotype (see Fig. 1). Among youth with the low-activity
MAOA genotype, deviant peer affiliation was significantly
related to change in overt ASB across adolescence and
early adulthood (=1.39, z=2.21, p<0.05). However,
among youth with the high-activity MAOA genotype,
deviant peer affiliation was an even stronger predictor of
overt ASB (=2.75, z=9.4, p<0.0001). Finally, because
deviant peer affiliation may be influenced by MAOA, it
was important to test their association. MAOA was
unrelated to deviant peer affiliation (r=0.05, p=0.23),
thereby reducing concerns about gene­environment corre-
lation (rGE) as an alternative explanation and strengthen-
ing the possibility of a potential gene × environment
interaction (G × E) for overt ASB.

Covert ASB: MAOA Genotype, Deviant Peer Affiliation,
and Their Interaction (G × E)
Based on 5 covert ASB items, identical models to those tested
for overt ASB above were separately tested for covert ASB (see
Table 3, Model 1 for model summary consisting of covariates
and main effects only). In the fully saturated model, consisting
of age, wave, deviant peer affiliation and MAOA genotype
main effects, and their interaction (Table 3, Model 2), deviant
peer affiliation was significantly related to covert ASB (=
1.88, z=3.99, p<0.0001) where individuals with more
extensive deviant peer affiliation reported higher levels of
their own covert ASB. However, MAOAwas not significantly
associated with covert ASB over time (=-0.11, z=-0.44, p=
0.66) and the interaction between deviant peer affiliation and
MAOA genotype was also nominal (=0.51, z=0.92, p=
0.36) (see Fig. 2).
Discussion
To address the significant gap in knowledge about potential
genetic and environmental influences on ASB, particularly
with respect to patterns of ASB over time, data were used
from a large sample of Caucasian adolescent boys followed
prospectively into early adulthood. This study is the first to
incorporate genotype as a moderator of deviant peer
affiliation and ASB. The association of the 30-base pair
variable number tandem repeat polymorphism of the
monoamine oxidase A (MAOA) gene, deviant peer
affiliation, and their interaction with self-reported overt
and covert ASB across a 6-year period was examined.
Consistent with the initial hypothesis, deviant peer affilia-
tion and the low-activity MAOA genotype each predicted
overt ASB where youth with the low-activity genotypes
reported significantly more overt ASB than youth with the
high-activity genotypes. Deviant peer affiliation also posi-
tively predicted levels of overt ASB across development,
independent of MAOA, age, and wave. There was evidence
suggestive of gene­environment interaction (G × E), but its
direction was inconsistent with our hypothesis. Deviant
peer affiliation positively predicted overt ASB more
robustly among youth with the high-activity MAOA
genotypes than youth with the low-activity genotypes.
Finally, deviant peer affiliation positively predicted covert
ASB, but no significant association was observed for
MAOA and its interaction with deviant peer affiliation.
Consistent with reports in the literature, individuals in this
sample with the low-activity MAOA genotypes reported
significantly higher levels of overt ASB across 6 years than
youth with high-activity MAOA genotypes. These same low-
activity MAOA genotypes have been implicated in conduct
disorder (CD) and criminal behavior (Prom-Wormley et al.
2009; Sjoberg et al. 2007) and substance use disorder
(Vanyukov et al. 2007), although null findings have also
been reported (Huizinga et al. 2006; Widom and Brzustowick
2006). Sample differences (e.g., treatment seeking vs.
population-based), phenotypic definitions (e.g., DSM-IV-
based vs. broader measures of ASB), and contrasting
approaches to defining the transcriptional efficiency of
MAOA polymorphisms (Deckert et al. 1999; Kim-Cohen et
al. 2006; Sabol et al. 1998) complicate efforts to directly
compare results across studies. Nevertheless, studies of
MAOA and endophenotypes related to ASB have illuminated
its effects on pathophysiology. Males with the low-activity
MAOA genotype had reduced left middle frontal gyrus
activation whereas individuals with the high-activity MAOA

genotype demonstrated heightened activity of neural circuits
associated with anger control during an emotional reactivity
task (Alia-Klein et al. 2008). The low-activity MAOA
genotype was also associated with antisocial personality
disorder and alterations in event related potential (ERP)
recording during a negative emotion-processing task (Wil-
liams et al. 2009). Of particular relevance to the study of ASB
and related phenotypes is the fact that in vivo studies of
MAOA genotype suggest pleiotropic effects, including
amygdala hyper-reactivity to emotional cues and differential
activation of caudal regions of the anterior cingulate, which
mediate cognitive and inhibitory control (Meyer-Lindenberg
et al. 2006). Given the centrality of negative affect and
cognitive dimensions of ASB (Lahey 2009; Martel et al.
2007), MAOA remains a candidate gene worthy of further
dissection.
The present study extended the search for moderators of
deviant peer affiliation and ASB to a functional MAOA
variant in an adolescent sample followed into adulthood.
Although there is evidence that the high-activity MAOA
genotypes are associated with more ASB (Beitchman et al.
2004; van der Vegt et al. 2009), the finding that deviant peer
affiliation predicted overt ASB in the high-activity more
robustly than in the low-activity genotype contradicted
previous studies, although they were based on maltreatment
(Caspi et al. 2002; Edwards et al. 2010; Kim-Cohen et al.
2006). Wakschlag et al. (2010) reported sex-specific G × E
results where the low-activity MAOA genotypes interacted
with prenatal nicotine exposure in boys, but it was the high-
activity MAOA genotypes for girls. Several factors may
explain the patterns observed thus far for G × E studies
involving MAOA and ASB. First, research on the develop-
ment of ASB has prioritized divergent pathways to and from
ASB. Loeber (1988) proposed distinct classes of ASB,
consisting of exclusive substance use, non-aggressive, and
pernicious aggressive/versatile pathways. Defined as equi-
finality, or multiple pathways eventuating in the same
outcome (i.e., ASB) (Cicchetti and Rogosch 1996), these
groups were empirically separable, but each was associated
with substance use problems (Loeber 1988). Thus, the
combination of deviant peer affiliation and high-activity
MAOA genotype for overt ASB may represent an empiri-
cally distinct group of ASB relative to the `main effect' of
the low-activity MAOA genotype when deviant peer
affiliation was controlled. Second, theorists have proposed
that the nature of deviant peer influences is not identical
across development and ASB subtypes. Lahey et al. (1999)
and Moffitt (1993) contend that deviant peer affiliation may
indicate latent genetic risk in some youth (i.e., life-course-
persistent; LCP), but play a more direct role for others (i.e.,
adolescence-limited individuals; AL). Because LCP ASB is
more heritable than AL ASB (Moffitt 2003), the stronger
effect of deviant peer affiliation in the high-activity group is
plausible because deviant peer affiliation may simply be less
consequential in the low-activity group. Similarly, the
relative contribution and precise role of deviant peer
affiliation and ASB in the high-activity genotypes may be
environmentally mediated through processes such as peer
reinforcement. In the low-activity MAOA genotype, deviant
peer affiliation may be secondary to the development of
overt ASB because it disrupts neural structures and circuitry,
which potentiate violence and related endophenotypes (i.e.,
negative emotionality) (Buckholtz and Meyer-Lindenberg
2008). Third, given that this sample consisted of adolescents
followed into adulthood, the interactive effects between
deviant peer affiliation and MAOA must be interpreted
within the context of developmental influences. Not only are
some forms of adolescent ASB normative (Moffitt 2003),
dynamic changes in the organization and connectivity of
neural systems related to ASB (e.g., learning, reward
sensitivity) (Galvan 2010) must be reconciled in future
developmentally-sensitive models of G × E. In fact, previous
studies of G × E for MAOA and ASB featured different
developmental periods and timelines for exposure to
environmental risk. Whereas Caspi et al. (2002) assessed
maltreatment when participants were between 3 and
11 years-old, physical discipline was assessed prior to age
6 by Edwards et al. (2010), and deviant peer affiliation was
assessed at ages 12­20 in this study.
Interactive models between MAO and environmental
risk have emerged, most notably for early maltreatment
(Weder et al. 2009; Kim-Cohen et al. 2006), but other forms
of adversity are being measured. Wakschlag et al. (2010)
found that prenatal nicotine exposure and the low-activity
MAOA genotypes predicted ASB in boys, but exposure
and the high-activity group predicted ASB in girls. Belsky
et al. (2009) re-conceptualized the nature of gene-
environment interplay for disease by emphasizing that
susceptibility genes concurrently function as plasticity
genes (i.e., contribute to positive outcome) in enriching
environments. Unlike diathesis-stress, the plasticity model
expects that the low-activity MAOA genotype will predict
higher ASB with environmental risk, but lower ASB with
environmental enrichment. In addition, deviant peer affili-
ation may not be purely environmentally mediated, partic-
ularly for groups of youth and at particular stages in
development, the patterns reported herein are potentially
consistent with this formulation. At low levels of deviant
peer affiliation, low-activity MAOA genotypes predicted
more overt ASB. However, the same low-activity MAOA
genotypes were associated with significantly lower levels of
overt ASB in the presence of high deviant peer affiliation.
Although this theory requires further empirical scrutiny, it
challenges assumptions about genetic susceptibility, envi-
ronmental adversity/nurturance, and the development of
psychopathology.

There are several important implications of this study.
Future studies of genetic and environmental influences on
psychopathology must transcend the identification of risk
factors and risk indicators to identify risk processes. Rutter
(2006) argued that genetic influences can be environmentally
mediated and environmental effects can be genetically
mediated. Thus, designations of genetic and environmental
risk do not necessarily convey the actual mechanisms
underlying their association with outcome. Identifying these
underlying processes should be prioritized in future genetical-
ly informative studies. For example, in this study, deviant peer
affiliation for the group of children with the high-risk MAOA
genotype may simply be a risk indicator rather than a
potential causal risk factor for youth without the low-risk
genotype. Next, developmental influences are frequently
ignored in genetic studies that rely on cross-sectional designs
and highly dispersed age ranges. But, prospective longitudinal
designs not only improve statistical power, they may also
change estimates on the prevalence of psychopathology
relative to retrospective designs (Moffitt et al. 2010). These
designs also permit informative tests of genotype × time
interactions to ascertain differences in genetic influence over
time. This is particularly relevant given that the heritability of
ASB changes from childhood to adolescence (Rhee and
Waldman 2002). Finally, future studies of G × E must
consider the possibility that different models of G × E and
rGE operate with respect to the etiology of disorder from
those models of interplay that may maintain or further amplify
initial trajectories of disorder.
The current study features several methodological assets
including a relatively large sample and a prospective
longitudinal design. However, there are several important
limitations. First, ASB was measured and analyzed as count
data, thereby preventing inferences about diagnostic criteria
(e.g., conduct disorder) and functional impairment. It is
unclear whether these patterns of association would be
preserved across other phenotypic approaches. Future
research must adopt alternative methods to phenotypic
classification that are developmentally-informed. For exam-
ple, Odgers et al. (2008) derived four latent classes from the
Dunedin sample using growth mixture models that were the
basis for hypotheses about the developmental trajectories of
offending in men and women. Coupled with prospective
longitudinal designs, latent class methods (e.g., latent
transition analysis) may discern groups of offenders and
potentially identify predictors of continuity. Second, this
sample consisted of a wide age range of participants (12­
20 years). Consequently, deviant peer affiliation cannot be
uniformly interpreted across this period. For example, for
young adult participants, having peers who smoke and
drink is likely to be quite normative relative to adolescents.
In fact, when the deviant peer affiliation construct featured
in this study excluded the items that assessed peers who
smoke and drank (based on the fact that 18­20 year-olds
can legally smoke and drink), the interaction with MAOA
was no longer significant (results available from author
upon request). Thus, peer deviance must be defined in
accordance with developmental theories and expectations
and perhaps also with socio-cultural standards. Third, Add
Health presently consists only of single polymorphisms
from five candidate genes. Thus, linkage disequilibrium
patterns could not be discerned and genomic control could
not be used to address population stratification with the
entire sample (i.e., including all racial-ethnic groups)
(Weder et al. 2009). Fourth, genome-wide approaches are
the emerging standard in genetics, allowing for anonymous
interrogation of variation across the entire genome. Because
complex phenotypes are explained by numerous genes,
each of modest effect size (Risch and Merikangas 1996),
traditional candidate gene approaches may progress the
field more slowly than genome-wide methods and related
innovations (e.g., copy number variation) (Cook and
Scherer 2008). Finally, the study does not provide methods
to identify potential mediating endophenotypes, particularly
those derived from in-vivo (e.g., neuroimaging) assays or
psychometrically-sound clinical assessment (e.g., neuropsy-
chological functioning). To advance the field, studies that
prioritize repeated measures, diverse genetic and biological
assays, and careful phenotypic characterization will im-
prove traction on gene­environment interplaying underly-
ing the development and persistence of ASB.
