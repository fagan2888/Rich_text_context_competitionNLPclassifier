Introduction
Myocardial infarction (MI) is a public health problem, and
it brings various health problems and threatens the life of
patients. MI is a multifactorial disease with a complex
pathogenesis where lifestyle, individual genetic back-
ground and environmental risk factors are involved.1
However, the pathogenesis of MI remains difficult to eluci-
date at the moment. Early diagnosis for MI risk is difficult
as there is no well-documented indicator which can predict
the onset of MI. In past decades, lots of studies found that
gene polymorphism might be associated with the risk of
some diseases and might become a potential marker for
early diagnosis of the onset of some diseases.2­5
The angiotensin II receptor includes two subtypes: type 1
receptor (angiotensin II type 1 receptor, AT1R) and type 2
receptor.6 TheAT1R, which is the primary pathogenic effector
for angiotensin II, is a member of the G-protein-coupled
receptor superfamily expressed in most tissues, where receptor
activation leads to vasoconstriction, water retention and vas-
cular smooth muscle cell proliferation and hypertrophy.7 The
AT1R is present predominantly in vascular smooth muscle
cells and because of the physiological role of the AT1R in the
cardiovascular system, the gene that encodes this molecule is

Abstract
Background and aim: Many reported studies have been conducted to investigate the association of angiotensin II type 1
receptor (AT1R) A1166C gene polymorphism with myocardial infarction (MI) susceptibility. However, the results from
those reports are still conflicting. This meta-analysis was performed to study the relationship between AT1R A1166C
gene polymorphism and MI risk.
Method: The databases of PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Library were searched as of 1 March 2012, and eligible inves-
tigations were recruited into this meta-analysis.
Results: Eighteen investigations were identified for the analysis of association between AT1R A1166C gene polymorphism
and MI risk, 11 in Caucasians, three in Asians, two in Africans, one in the population of Brazil and one in the popula-
tion of Durban, South Africa . There was a marked association between AT1R C allele and MI susceptibility for overall
populations (odds ratio (OR)=1.12, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.01­1.25, p=0.03), and AT1R AA genotype was asso-
ciated with a lower risk of MI in overall populations (OR=0.87, 95% CI: 0.78­0.98, p=0.02). However, AT1R A1166C
gene polymorphism was not associated with MI risk in the sub-groups of Caucasians, Asians, Africans, Brazil and Durban
populations.
Conclusions: C allele is a risk factor for the MI susceptibility in overall populations, and AA genotype might be a protec-
tive factor against the MI risk in overall populations. However, more case-control association investigations on larger,
stratified populations are required in the future.

an excellent candidate in the etiology of cardiovascular dis-
eases8 AT1RA1166C gene polymorphism, an important muta-
tion of AT1R, might be implicated in the etiology of MI
susceptibility and had been investigated in numerous epide-
miologic studies. Zhang et al.9 performed the first meta-analy-
sis to study the association of the AT1R gene A1166C
polymorphisms with MI risk, and found an association of the
C allele of AT1R gene A1166C polymorphisms with MI risk.
This meta-analysis was performed to update the conclusion of
the relationship between AT1R A1166C gene polymorphism
and MI susceptibility, with the intention to provide a much
more reliable finding of the significance of this association.
Furthermore, this meta-analysis first explored the association
of AT1R A1166C gene polymorphism with MI susceptibility
for different ethnicities.
Materials and methods
Search strategy
Search strategy for the association of AT1R A1166C gene poly-
morphism with MI risk. Relevant studies were sought from
the electronic databases of PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane
Library on 1 March 2012. The retrieval strategy was that
(angiotensin II type-1 receptor) AND polymorphism AND
(myocardial infarction) were entered into these databases.
The search in PubMed or Embase was limited to English
language. Additional articles were identified through refer-
ences cited in the retrieved articles.
Inclusion and exclusion criteria
Inclusion and exclusion criteria for MI. Inclusion criteria
were (a) a case­control study; (b) the outcome had to be
MI; (c) there had to be at least two comparison groups (MI
group vs control group); (d) investigation on the associa-
tion of AT1R A1166C gene polymorphism with MI risk.
Exclusion criteria were (a) review articles and editorials;
(b) case reports; (c) investigation did not provide detailed
data of AT1R A1166C genotype distributions; (d) prelimi-
nary results not about AT1R A1166C gene polymorphism
(investigation on the association of other gene polymor-
phism, such as angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE)
insertion/deletion gene polymorphism, with MI risk) or MI
risk (investigation on the association of AT1R A1166C
gene polymorphism with the risk of other diseases, such as
renal disease); (e) investigating the role of AT1R inhibitors
in diseases.
Data extraction and synthesis
Two investigators extracted the following information from
each eligible study independently: first author's surname,
year of publication and the number of cases and controls for
AT1R A1166C genotypes. The frequency of C allele was
calculated for the case group or the control group, from the
corresponding genotype distribution. The results were
compared and disagreements were resolved by discussion.
Statistical analysis
Cochrane Review Manager Version 5 (Cochrane Library,
UK) was used to calculate the available data from each
investigation. The pooled statistic was counted using the
fixed effects model, but a random effects model was per-
formed when the p value of heterogeneity test was less than
0.1.10,11 Results were expressed with odds ratio (OR) for
dichotomous data, and 95% confidence interval (CI) were
also calculated.12,13 For the pooled OR to be statistically sig-
nificant, p<0.05 was required. I2 was used to test the hetero-
geneity among the included studies.14,15 In order to avoid
excessive comparisons, the OR was calculated by using three
methods: method 1, allele comparison (C allele vs A allele);
method 2, comparing CC homozygous with the other two
combinations (CC vs CA+AA); method 3, comparing AA
genotype with the other two combinations (AA vs CC+CA).
A chi-square (2) test using a web-based program was
applied to determine if genotype distributions of the control
population reported conformed to Hardy-Weinberg equilib-
rium (HWE; p<0.05 was considered significant), and if the
genotype distributions in the controls significantly deviated
from HWE then the study was excluded from our sensitive
analysis. The Begg adjusted rank correlation test16 and the
Egger regression asymmetry test17 were used for exploring
publication bias (p<0.1 was considered significant) when the
sample number was more than 10. All descriptive data were
expressed as mean±standard deviation (SD).
Results
Study characteristics for MI
A total of 115 articles were retrieved in PubMed (70),
Embase (43), and Cochrane Library (2). Ninety-seven
articles were excluded for the following reasons: review
articles, editorials, case reports, preliminary result not
about AT1R A1166C gene polymorphism or MI, investi-
gating the role of AT1R inhibitors in diseases. Eighteen
articles were recruited into our investigation for the rela-
tionship between AT1R A1166C gene polymorphism and
MI susceptibility (Figure 1). The data of interest were
extracted: first author's surname, year of publication and
the number of cases and controls for AT1R A1166C geno-
types (Table 1). Those 18 investigations18­35 contained
6794 cases and 6204 controls, including 11 studies of
Caucasians,18­28 three studies of Asians,29,30,35 two studies
of Africans,31,34 one study in the population of Durban in
South Africa,32 and one study in the Brazilian popula-
tion.33 The average frequency of C allele distribution in
patients with MI for overall populations was 24.74% and
Feng et al. 309
the average frequency in controls was 22.58%. The aver-
age frequency of C allele distribution in Caucasians was
29.43% in cases and 27.83% for controls. Furthermore,
the average frequency of C allele distribution in Asians
with MI was 15.11%, and the average frequency in con-
trols was 11.27%. In African population, the average fre-
quency of C allele distribution in MI patients was 22.05%,
and the average frequency in controls was 17.92%. In
Durban population, the frequency of C allele distribution
in MI patients was 4.38%, and the frequency in controls
was 5.18%. In Brazil population, the frequency of C allele
distribution in MI patients was 27.73%, and the frequency
in controls was 25.48%. The average frequency of C allele
in patients with MI for overall populations was similar to
that in controls (MI/controls=1.10). The ratio of MI/con-
trol for the average frequency of C allele distribution in
Asians or Africans was notably higher than that in
Caucasians, the Durban population, or the Brazil popula-
tion (Asians: MI/control=1.34;Africans: MI/control=1.23;
Caucasians: MI/control=1.06; Durban population: MI/
control=0.85; Brazil population: MI/control=1.09).
Association of AT1R A1166C gene
polymorphism with MI risk
In this meta-analysis, a significant association between C
allele and MI risk was observed in overall populations (Figure
2(A); Table 2). However, the CC genotype was not associated
withtheMIsusceptibility(Figure2(B);Table2).Interestingly,
AA genotype might be a protective factor against the risk of
MI in overall populations (Figure 2(C); Table 2).
Difference in race might have affected the results of our
analysis for the association of AT1R A1166C gene poly-
morphism with MI susceptibility. In order to evaluate this
effect, we divided the population by ethnicity. There was no
association between AT1R A1166C gene polymorphism
and MI susceptibility in Caucasians, Asians, Africans, pop-
ulations of Durban and Brazil (Table 2).

Sensitivity analysis
Three studies (two in Caucasians22,25 and one in Asians29)
for which the genotype distributions in the controls were
significantly deviated from HWE were excluded.
In the sensitivity analysis for overall populations, we
found that the results were similar with those in the non-
sensitivity analysis. A significant association between C
allele and MI risk was observed in overall populations, and
AA genotype might be a protective factor against the risk of
MI in overall populations (Table 2).
In Caucasians, the results in sensitivity analysis were simi-
lar to those in the non-sensitivity analysis (Table 2).
Furthermore, the results from sensitivity analysis in Africans,
the Durban population and the Brazil population were the
same as those from the non-sensitivity analysis (Table 2).
Interestingly, in Asians, there was a significant association
between C allele and MI risk, and AA genotype might be a
protective factor against the risk of MI (Table 2).These results
from the Asian studies had a sensitivity analysis inconsistent
with those in the non-sensitivity analysis.
Testing for publication bias for the analysis
of association of AT1R A1166C gene
polymorphism and MI susceptibility in
overall populations, and in Caucasians
There was no significant publication bias in overall popula-
tions (Begg: p=0.967; Egger: p=0.893; Figure 3(A)) and in
Caucasians (Begg: p=0.161; Egger: p=0.112; Figure 3(B)).
Discussion
The AT1R is the primary pathogenic effector for angioten-
sin II, which takes part in the etiology of cardiovascular
diseases, such as MI. In our study, we found that AT1R
A1166C gene polymorphism was associated with MI sus-
ceptibility in overall populations. In our meta-analysis,
there was a significant association between the C allele
and MI risk in overall populations, and AA genotype was
associated with a lower risk of MI in overall populations.
However, CC genotype was not associated with MI risk for
overall populations. We also performed a sensitivity analy-
sis, and found that the results for overall populations were
similar to those in the non-sensitivity analysis. There was
no publication bias in overall populations. The results from
the overall populations might be robust to some extent.
According to the duration time of the MI, MI can be
divided into acute MI and `old' MI, etc. Diagnosis of defi-
nite AMI was based on World Health Organization (WHO)
criteria, i.e. patients should have any two of the following
three conditions: resting anginal chest pain lasting more
than 30 min, ST segment elevation >1 mm above baseline
in at least two leads of a standard 12-lead electrocardio-
gram, and creatinine phosphokinase (CPK) and CPK-MB
elevation to at least twice the upper limit of the normal
range. Diagnosis of definite old MI was based on WHO
criteria, and the duration of the MI was more than three
months. In this study, we also performed a meta-analysis to
investigate the association of AT1R A1166C gene polymor-
phism with acute MI/old MI susceptibility. Ten repo

rts19,23,24,26,29,30,32­35 were included for acute MI, and two
reports25,27 were included for old MI. Whether the MI in the
other studies was acute MI or old MI was not clear. In our
study, we found that the results for acute MI were similar to
those from MI (acute MI: C allele: OR=1.17, 95% CI:
1.01­1.34, p=0.03; CC genotype: OR=1.10, 95% CI: 0.92­
1.32, p=0.28; AA genotype: OR=0.84, 95% CI: 0.71­0.99,
p=0.03). However, AT1R A1166C gene polymorphism was
not associated with old MI susceptibility (old MI: C allele:
OR=1.02, 95% CI: 0.89­1.17, p=0.77; CC genotype:
OR=0.95, 95% CI: 0.69­1.30, p=0.74; AA genotype:
OR=0.95, 95% CI: 0.80­1.13, p=0.58). The number of
included studies for old MI was small, and the results might
be less robust.
The frequency of the C allele in some studies29,31,32,35
was very low compared to that in other included studies,
and those studies were excluded from our further meta-
analysis. The frequency of C allele in the case group of the
study from Mehri et al.34 was much higher than that in the
control group (41.1% vs 29.33%), and this study was also
excluded from our further meta-analysis. We re-ran the
meta-analysis and found that the pooled OR for the C allele
was favorable to the case group, although the difference was
not statistically significant (OR=1.09, 95% CI: 0.99­1.19,

p=0.07). Furthermore, the pooled OR for the AA allele was
favorable to the control group, although the difference was
not statistically significant (OR=0.93, 95% CI: 0.86­1.00,
p=0.05). However, CC genotype was not associated with
the risk of MI (p=0.24). More well-designed studies should
be conducted in the future.
Ethnic variables might have affected the evaluation of
the association of gene polymorphism with the susceptibil-
ity of disease.36,37 In this meta-analysis, we also tested the
ethnic variable in the evaluation of association of AT1R
A1166C gene polymorphism with MI susceptibility. Most
of the recruited studies were from Caucasians. We found
that the AT1R A1166C gene polymorphism was not associ-
ated with MI susceptibility in Caucasians. Furthermore,
the results for Caucasians were similar to those in the
non-sensitivity analysis. There was no publication bias in
studies of Caucasians. The difference of the C allele distri-
bution between the MI group and control group in
Caucasians was not notable (MI/control=1.06). To sum up
the findings mentioned above, AT1R A1166C gene poly-
morphism was not associated with MI susceptibility in
Caucasians, and the result might be robust to some extent.
In Caucasians, Berget al.18 reported that CC homozygo-
sity appeared to be associated with MI in the Norwegian
population. Fernandez-Arcas et al.20 found that the CC
genotype is an independent risk factor for MI. Canavy et
al.21 reported the prevalence of the C allele carriers being
higher in patients with MI than in control individuals.
However, some other studies reported that AT1R A1166C
gene polymorphism was not associated with the MI

risk19,22­25,27 AT1R A1166C gene polymorphism might be
not associated with MI susceptibility in Caucasians.
However, more studies in Caucasians should be performed
in the future.
In Asians, AT1R A1166C gene polymorphism might be
not associated with MI susceptibility. However, in the sen-
sitivity analysis, there was a significant association between
the C allele and MI risk, and AA genotype was associated
with a lower risk of MI. These results from the sensitivity
analysis were inconsistent with those in the non-sensitivity
analysis. However, there were only three studies in our
meta-analysis for Asians, and only two studies in the sensi-
tivity analysis. The difference of C allele distribution
between MI group and control group in Asians was notable
(MI/control=1.34). To sum up those findings mentioned
above, AT1R A1166C gene polymorphism might be associ-
ated with the MI susceptibility in Asians.
In Asians, Su et al.29 reported that AT1R A1166C gene
polymorphism might affect the MI susceptibility in Chinese.
Kaur et al.35 found that the AT1R 1166A/C gene polymor-
phism had an association with AMI among north Indian
patients. However, Bhoomi et al.30 reported that the AT1R
A1166C CC genotype is not a risk factor for MI in patients
in a South Indian population. The number of the included
studies for Asians was small, and it would be difficult for us
to draw a robust conclusion for Asians. More studies in
Asians should be performed in the future.
In Africans, the Durban population and the Brazilian
population, the conclusions from the sensitivity analysis
were inconsistent with those in the non-sensitivity analysis.
There was no association between AT1R A1166C gene pol-
ymorphism and MI susceptibility in Africans, the Durban
population, and Brazilian population. The number of the
included studies for Africans, the Durban population, or
Brazilian population was much too small, and it would be
difficult for us to draw a robust conclusion from them.
Further studies in Africans, the Durban population, and the
Brazilian population should be performed.
Interestingly, Zhang et al.9 performed the first meta-
analysis to study the association of the AT1R gene A1166C
polymorphisms with MI risk, and found an association of
the C allele of AT1R gene A1166C polymorphisms with MI
risk in overall populations. It was similar with our result in
this meta-analysis. In this meta-analysis, we found that the
AT1RA1166C gene polymorphism was not associated with
the MI susceptibility in Caucasians, and there was no sig-
nificant publication bias. Interestingly, AT1R A1166C gene
polymorphism might be associated with the MI susceptibil-
ity in Asians in the sensitivity analysis, and the frequency
of C allele in the MI group was marked higher than that in
the control group in Asians. However, more studies for
Asians should be performed in the future.
Those findings mentioned above should be regarded
cautiously because many other aspects, such as heterogene-
ity of enrolled cases, limited statistical power, variable
study designs and different interventions, were likely to
affect the results. Furthermore, whether the AT1R A1166C
gene polymorphism is just linked with other discrete loci
involved in the occurrence of MI is not clear at the moment.
In conclusion, C allele is a risk factor for the MI suscep-
tibility in overall populations, and AA genotype might be a
protective factor against the MI risk in overall populations.
Furthermore, AT1R C allele/AA genotype might be associ-
ated with MI susceptibility in Asians. However, more case-
control association investigations into larger, stratified
populations are required in the future.
