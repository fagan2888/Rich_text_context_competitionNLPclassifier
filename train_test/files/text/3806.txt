Longitudinal health studies are often hampered by high
rates of loss to follow-up of participants (Davis, Broome,
& Cox, 2002). Although loss to follow-up can be a prob-
lem in any prospective study, older adults, minorities, and
people with low incomes can be particularly difficult to
recruit and retain (Kagawa-Singer, 2000; Napoles &
Chadiha, 2011). Nonrandom loss to follow-up can bias
results and affect the accuracy, validity, and translational
value of research (Groves, 2006; Matthews, Chatfield,
Freeman, McCracken, & Brayne, 2004), making it difficult
to apply results to underrepresented groups or to develop
inclusive evidence-based health policies and practice
guidelines that support population health equity (Odierna
& Schmidt, 2009; Tugwell, de Savigny, Hawker, &
Robinson, 2006).
The objective of our study was to deepen understanding
of multidimensional barriers to and facilitators of participant
retention in community-based and outpatient health studies.
We explored how social health determinants and characteris-
tics of research participants, studies, and the context in which
research is conducted might interact to affect loss to follow-
up of diverse groups of participants in a broad range of stud-
ies at three academic research centers.
Method
We collected data using minimally structured focus groups
and interviews. Focus groups are particularly appropriate for
uncovering new information about complex, multidimen-
sional issues and addressing real-world problems (Creswell,
2007; Millward, 2012). We used inductive thematic analysis
to describe and understand research participation from the
perspective of researchers and research participants and to
explore researchers' and participants' perceptions of things
that might influence research participants to leave or stay in
studies (Guest, MacQueen, & Namey, 2012).
We conducted a total of six focus groups at three sites. At
each site, we conducted two focus groups: one with researchers
and other study personnel, and the other with current and for-
mer study participants, all from a wide variety of longitudinal

Retaining Participants in Outpatient
and Community-Based Health Studies:
Researchers and Participants in Their
Own Words

Abstract
Loss to follow-up can introduce bias into research, making it difficult to develop inclusive evidence-based health policies
and practice guidelines. We aimed to deepen understanding of reasons why participants leave or remain in longitudinal
health studies. We interviewed 59 researchers and current and former research participants in six focus groups (n = 55) or
interviews (n = 4) at three study centers in a large academic research institution. We used minimally structured interview
guides and inductive thematic analysis to explore participant-level, study-level, and contextual participation barriers and
facilitators. Four main themes emerged: transportation, incentives and motivation, caregiver concerns, and the social and
physical environment. Themes shared crosscutting issues involving funding, flexibility, and relationships between researchers
and research participants. Study-level and contextual factors appear to interact with participant characteristics, particularly
socioeconomic status and disease severity to affect participant retention. Participants' characteristics do not seem to be the
main cause of study dropout. Researchers and funders might be able to address contextual and study factors in ways that
reduce barriers to participation.

studies. We also conducted individual interviews with four
study dropouts who responded to recruitment materials but
declined to participate in focus groups. We used an iterative
process throughout the project and in our inductive analysis.
Study Sites
The focus groups took place at three research centers associ-
ated with a large university located in the Western United
States. One center (Site A) was chosen specifically for its
research with aging populations and its large cohort of older
adult patients and healthy controls. The other two sites (Sites
B and C) were selected from among six clinical research cen-
ters. Of these six, four were excluded because they were not
available during our study window, because they conducted
primarily pediatric research, or, in one case, because the cen-
ter director felt that an open recruitment and focus group for-
mat posed a threat of contamination to one or more
randomized clinical trials being conducted there. While some
clinical trials are conducted at the study sites, most of the
research projects at all three sites are multiyear observational
studies. Some studies include biological measures, from
blood pressure checks and cheek swabs to more invasive
procedures such as blood draws or lumbar punctures.
Site A is located in two medical buildings. Clinical assess-
ments take place on an upper floor of a bustling patient care
center with a busy reception area. Study participants are
interviewed in a nearby medical office building, with dedi-
cated interview rooms and small, quiet reception areas. Site
A offers medical and support services for patients, family
members, and other caregivers, and holds educational events
where participants can meet and interact with one another. At
any given time, Site A generally houses more than two dozen
ongoing studies, including a large multiyear study of demen-
tia and healthy aging, and a separate study of aging and cog-
nition in Asian Americans.
Site B is located away from the university, in a small
building at the edge of an inner-city neighborhood character-
ized by vibrant street life, social disadvantage, poverty, and
homelessness. The outside door to the research center opens
onto a busy sidewalk. During the day, commuters, tourists,
and shoppers throng the area. At all times, area residents pass
by, meet, and congregate. The center is on the second floor.
An elevator and an open staircase lead to a reception area
where research participants can congregate, talk with each
other and the receptionist, make phone calls, use the rest
room, and obtain information about services and other stud-
ies that are recruiting new participants. Site B's research
focus is on participants who are generally considered hard to
retain: poor, largely minority, and marginalized populations
living with HIV. Even so, most Site B studies have high
retention rates, generally more than 95%. Many of the
research participants live in the area, and the site is easily
accessible by public transit. The center conducts participant
events designed to develop an inviting atmosphere and a
sense of community. There are more than a dozen interview
rooms and a phlebotomy station on-site. Site B generally
houses between 5 and 10 large observational and behavioral
studies and, occasionally, clinical trials. Most of the studies
are multiyear projects.
Site C is a clinical research center located on an upper
floor of a busy hospital. The site has several examination and
interview rooms, medical testing facilities, nursing services,
and a clinical trials unit. The check-in desk faces a corridor
that connects several departments. There is no designated
space for participants to congregate, although they can use
patient and family waiting rooms on the same floor. At any
given time, Site C houses approximately 150 clinical and
behavioral studies.
Recruitment and Participants
We first met with research center directors to discuss our
study. The directors introduced us to research coordinators
who helped us contact research personnel and participants
for our focus groups and interviews. We recruited research
personnel for our focus groups at staff meetings, on staff
email lists, by posting flyers at the research centers. We
emphasized that we were studying the research process, not
any individual study, and that the long-term objective was to
improve retention rates in future studies. Researchers at
every level were eligible if they worked on prospective out-
patient or community-based clinical or observational studies
at the study sites or had ongoing contact with research par-
ticipants at those sites.
We recruited study participants for our focus groups with
flyers posted in reception areas and hallways or distributed
by research staff. In addition, Site A researchers sent letters
to former research participants who had dropped out of Site
A studies, inviting them to participate in our focus group
study. Our recruitment materials emphasized that we were
studying the research process rather than research partici-
pants, and that their participation would help researchers
conduct better future studies. We screened all volunteers who
responded to our recruitment materials. Research partici-
pants were eligible if they were enrolled in studies at the
research center or if they were caregivers who were respon-
sible for transporting a patient to the study site. Other inclu-
sion criteria were proficiency in spoken English by the
subject or caregiver, age 18 or older, and current or recent
participation in a prospective study of at least 6 months dura-
tion and two study visits. Study dropouts were eligible if they
had left such a study at one of the study sites within the pre-
vious 4 years. Our exclusion criteria were inability to pro-
vide consent to participate in our study, and participation in
or conduct of only inpatient studies or studies with cross-
sectional, retrospective, or other nonlongitudinal designs.
We closed recruitment for each focus group when we con-
firmed a maximum of 12 participants. We conducted focus
groups and interviews from June 2011 through May 2012.

Data Collection
We conducted 90-min focus groups with study personnel
during lunch breaks or after hours in meeting rooms located
at the research centers. We asked about characteristics of
studies and study participants, and factors that might help or
impede the retention of participants through all phases of
research. We started with questions about the attendees'
experiences as researchers, their roles, and the studies they
worked on. We continued with conversations about their per-
ceptions of participant retention and study types, target pop-
ulations, participants' characteristics, hard-to-retain study
participants, follow-up protocols, and other topics that
emerged in the discussions. We conducted focus groups with
study participants in meeting rooms off-site or on-site at a
time when most study personnel were not present. We started
each focus group with warm-up questions about the types
and number of studies the attendees had participated in. We
then discussed their experiences as research participants, and
whether and why they completed studies, missed visits, or
dropped out. In addition, we asked about factors that made it
easy or difficult for them to participate in research. We also
conducted telephone interviews with four dropouts from Site
A studies who responded to our outreach materials but said
that they did not want to participate in the focus groups.
Because we were especially interested in including their
experiences, we offered them the option of participating via
individual 30-min in-person or telephone interviews. The
interviews with study dropouts covered areas similar to those
discussed in focus groups, with special emphasis on why
they left the studies and whether there were ways they might
have been retained. We used discussion guides that were
minimally structured and inductive; that is, earlier conversa-
tions informed questions and probing in subsequent groups
and interviews. To minimize effects of our own preconcep-
tions and collect data that reflected focus group participants'
perceptions and experiences rather than ours, we used mini-
mally structured interview guides and spoke minimally dur-
ing the focus groups and interviews. We made efforts not to
inject our opinions and into the conversations (Bradbury-
Jones, Sambrook, & Irvine, 2009). We encouraged all focus
group participants to speak throughout the sessions, and
probed when necessary to elicit more information.
All focus group participants received a US$40 cash incen-
tive in appreciation of their time and trouble; interviewees
received US$25. We provided meals or substantial snacks
that were appropriate for the time of day when the focus
groups took place. We decided a priori not to collect sociode-
mographic data. There were two main reasons for this deci-
sion. First, we believed that the site differences were greater
and more meaningful than differences among individual par-
ticipants. This would render analysis by sociodemographic
characteristics of individuals misleading. Second, our stated
purpose during the recruitment phase of our project was to
examine the research process itself, rather than the partici-
pants in our study. We made note of the apparent age, gender,
and racial/ethnic makeup of the focus groups and the ways
attendees described themselves.
Data Analysis
We recorded focus groups and interviews. The digital record-
ings were transcribed verbatim by a professional transcrip-
tion service that has been used by other qualitative researchers
at our institution. We began our analysis after conducting our
first focus group and continued throughout the study. We
first read each transcript to get an overall view of the discus-
sion, then we reread and identified relevant statements. We
then grouped similar statements into categories, and we
organized these into themes. We developed codes to repre-
sent the themes we identified, created an overall thematic
matrix (Guest et al., 2012) organized into final themes and
characteristics that focus group participants that were identi-
fied as having substantial effects on the ability of studies to
retain participants. We identified as themes broad factors that
appear to have substantial effects on the research process.
We identified as characteristics the specific attributes of
study participants, study design, and implementation, and the
context in which studies take place. Throughout the study,
one researcher (dho) manually coded the data. We used a pre-
liminary multilevel coding scheme (participant, study, and
context) to identify themes and characteristics. Another
researcher (lab) reviewed and analyzed transcripts and text
block on an ongoing basis, and suggested additional catego-
ries for the coding scheme.
We used the preliminary scheme to code the dataset in
more detail, using an inductive, iterative process to revise the
original coding as new insights and patterns appeared. We
discussed the coding with other researchers, including a stu-
dent intern who attended some focus groups and a colleague
who is an expert in qualitative methods. We then created
working data tables for research personnel and study partici-
pants. We asked for feedback on our coding and focus group
matrices from several researchers who participated in the
focus groups. The use of such informant feedback is a way of
establishing dependability in qualitative research (Creswell,
2007). The data we present are based on the comments of
multiple participants or discussions that took place in multi-
ple focus groups. The quotes we chose for incorporation into
the text are representative of these discussions or illustrate
variations in the data.
Human Subjects
This study was approved by the Committee on Human
Research (CHR) of the University of California, San
Francisco Human Research Protection Program, Approval
11-05235. To protect the confidentiality of our participants,
we obtained verbal consent and provided CHR-approved
study information sheets. Incentives were paid in cash,
receipts recorded only study ID numbers. Researchers con-
ducting the studies that provided the pool of volunteers were

not advised if any of their staff or research participants par-
ticipated in our study. We asked participants to avoid using
names during the conversations, and we strictly limited
access to the transcripts to our research team.
Results
We recruited 63 researchers and research participants for six
focus groups at three research centers. Of those 63 individu-
als, 55 (85%) attended and 8 (15%) were no shows. Of these
55, 23 were researchers and 32 were current and former
research participants or study dropouts. In addition to the 55
focus group participants, four study dropouts who responded
to our outreach materials declined to participate in the focus
groups, but agreed to individual interviews. Therefore, 59
people participated in our study. Almost all of the researchers
and most of the research participants/dropouts said that they
had been involved in more than one study, and many said
that they had participated in multiple studies over time.
Several research participants who attended the focus groups
mentioned that although they were currently actively partici-
pating in a study, they had dropped out of previous studies.
Five participant focus group attendees identified themselves
as caregivers for participants in our focus groups and in other
research studies.
About three quarters of the people who participated in our
study (44/59) were women. Research participant focus
groups included 13 research subjects from Site A studies, 9
from Site B studies, and 10 from Site C studies. Most research
participants appeared to be middle age and older adults; six
identified themselves as caregivers who were responsible for
escorting research participants to and from study sites. There
were very few young adults in the research subject focus
groups. The subject groups were diverse; about half appeared
to be or identified themselves in conversation as members of
racial or ethnic minority groups; attendees in the Site A par-
ticipant study group included six people who were research
subjects or caregivers in a study of cognition and aging in
older Chinese adults. The four study dropouts whom we
interviewed by telephone described themselves as retire-
ment-aged, but all said that they were currently self-employed
or working as volunteers. The research personnel worked at
three academic research centers; the focus groups included
11 researchers from Site A, 5 from Site B, and 7 from Site C.
Research personnel ranged in age and professional status
from young adults in their first research jobs to senior staff,
and included receptionists, research coordinators, interview-
ers, clinicians, center directors, and principal investigators.
Analysis of data from the focus group and interview tran-
scripts yielded four major themes: transportation, participant
incentives and motivation, caregiver concerns, and the phys-
ical and social environment. Within these themes, character-
istics of participants, studies, and context emerged as barriers
to or facilitators of participant retention (Table 1). Three
crosscutting issues:funding, flexibility, and relationships,
were common to all of the themes (not shown in the tabular
form).
Theme 1: Transportation
Researchers and participants alike described transportation
as an important element in the retention of research partici-
pants. Within this theme, we found that multilevel character-
istics act as barriers or facilitators; these include income,
access to a car and other resources, comorbidity and disease
severity, site accessibility, and the ability of investigators to
reschedule visits and reallocate resources. Discussions also
frequently centered on such contextual factors as public
safety and transit options:
Like the last time they scheduled the MRI, it was at night and I
couldn't come because he's [paid caregiver] going to accompany
me . . . it sounds kind of silly but I didn't want to come down
there on the bus at night. (Participant)
If it's local, then you can pay for a cab or a bus pass. Actually, I
can't tell you how many hours it took to figure out how to pay
for bus passes . . . I don't think we were ever able to do it.
(Researcher)
Researchers said that they knew that reimbursing study
participants for transportation costs was extremely impor-
tant, but that funding rather than participants' needs usually
determined their ability to pay:
We can barely pay for a parking sticker . . . after NIH cuts your
funding by 20% you end up with a limited budget and you face
well, should I have one less staff person so I can't analyze my
data . . . or should I boost up the travel money? (Researcher)
Like their travel was reimbursed [by the private sponsor] and we
were getting paid hundreds of dollars on a per-patient basis to
run the study, so it gave us a lot of incentive and a lot of money
to play with to actually get the patients in when they needed to
get in. (Researcher)
Study protocols and personal interactions between study
personnel and participants were important in meeting trans-
portation challenges and retaining a study's particular target
population. An interviewer described taking special care
with older participants, saying "Our offices are hard to find.
The better I give them instructions on how to do that the
smoother that goes, I think the less scared of it they are in the
future." Flexibility in the implementation phase of studies
emerged as a facilitator of participant retention, allowing
researchers to address individual concerns that might other-
wise cause participants to drop out. A participant in a pri-
vately funded clinical study told the group how he was able
to participate even though he had to travel a long distance:
I have PTSD. And so for me to take the train by myself was kind
of a trip, plus I had to pay for the train before I got there. They
Odierna and Bero 5
had someone meet me at the station, pay for my fare, and ride
with me. (Participant)
Study participants' proximity to their study site, conve-
nient and affordable public transit, or access to a car and
convenient parking facilitated participation. Researchers
said that participants who lived far from study sites or who
moved far away during the course of a study were very dif-
ficult to retain. Changes in participants' employment status
can affect the time they have available for study visits and

the ability of long-distance participants to afford travel
expenses:
When I joined, I was working. The flight was cheap, and I
arranged other things to do there. Now I'm retired and I have
time but not the money. If they could have covered some of my
expenses, I might've stayed. (Study dropout)
Researchers who took part in the focus groups said that
culture, language, and socioeconomic status (SES) have sub-
stantial effects on transportation logistics. They said that the
interactions led to special challenges in getting some partici-
pants to research sites:
I should also say for [some populations], distance is an issue in
a very different way. A lot of people who live, for instance, in
Chinatown really don't feel that comfortable coming up here [to
a research site in another part of the city] and that's a barrier that
the rest of our cohort doesn't experience. And it's certainly true
for the less educated, less acculturated group. (Researcher)
Theme 2: Participant Incentives and Motivation
Researchers and research participants repeatedly described
monetary and nonmonetary participant incentives as impor-
tant motivators. However, investigators said that funding
levels and ethical concerns about participant coercion limit
the amount of financial compensation they can offer. Funding
policies and regulations can also impede the flexibility
researchers need to respond to changing and emerging needs
of the population during study implementation. Research
participants stressed that monetary incentives should be con-
gruent with study-related risks and burdens to participants
and caregivers. Research participants from Site B, mostly
poor and at best marginally employed, said that monetary
incentives were the primary reason they participated in
research and that they looked for studies that paid well. "I
mean, the money. We're sitting here and we're telling you
it's the money." They and others expressed concerns that
money might persuade people with low incomes to partici-
pate in studies when otherwise they might not, although no
one said that this applied to them personally. Research par-
ticipants from all sites made it clear that money would not
motivate them to undergo what they perceived as dangerous
medical procedures or participate in studies they felt would
threaten their health. Some said that they were disinclined to
participate in for-profit research because they did not trust in
industry sponsors. Some Site B participants, who for the
most part said that they were motivated primarily by finan-
cial incentives, agreed,
Participant 1: Well I wouldn't do a smoking group sponsored by
Phillip Morris [large tobacco company].
Participant 2: If you're taking my medical information and using
it to market, not to improve the field but to market, it is just
queasy for some reason.
Participant 3: For these drugs to get on the market, they have to
show progress with it, you know . . . the FDA won't fund them
anymore.
Although many of the research participants in Site B and
C participant focus groups said that money was the most
importantmotivator,thiswasnotalwaysthecase.Researchers
from Site A said that older, highly educated, and affluent par-
ticipants sometimes did not even accept incentive payments.
In all groups, the need for information and the salience of the
research topic emerged as especially important motivators
for patients in studies of conditions with few treatment
options:
I'd say the financial incentive's huge if it's not something that
affects you. Like if you're a healthy control or you're just
participating "because." But if it's maybe a medical condition
you have, for me, I would've done the study either way. Luckily
it paid. (Participant)
However, unmet expectations could cause participants to
express dissatisfaction or even to leave studies:
They really don't tell you anything except that "if we think that
you have a serious, you know, problem, we'll let you know" . . .
So it seemed like very much for me a black hole. I found that not
very satisfying 'cause it was taking a fair amount of time and
that's why I kind of just decided to leave. I thought I was going
to get a little more information and I got pretty much no
information out of it. (Study dropout)
While some participants emphasized the importance of
perceived personal benefit in the form of information or
monetary incentives, many described volunteerism and the
desire to help others as important motivations. Others
talked about how participation in research gave them a feel-
ing of connection to the scientific community and enabled
them to contribute to advancements in medicine. Several
participants who were healthy controls in studies character-
ized their own altruism as part of a larger social commit-
ment to science and population health. Some researchers
said that they frequently saw this particular motivation
among highly educated participants, and that education and
culture played an important role, especially among immi-
grants. One researcher who worked primarily with immi-
grant populations said, "Most of the time I see the
[immigrants] who are, who do have that concept, contribut-
ing to the greater good and research, are probably PhDs or
if not, at least college graduates." Another said that it is
important for researchers not to project their own values
onto their research subjects:
I think we're used to the idea of like the culture we grew up in
and the fact that we work here, that oh, I want to contribute to
research is like even a concept. And I feel like other cultures it's
not necessarily this idea that oh, I'm contributing to science by
being a research subject. (Researcher)
Odierna and Bero 7
The discussions of motivations of altruism, volunteerism,
and scientific importance were animated and enthusiastic:
Whenever I see something on the board I can qualify for, part of
it is, "Oh, I'm getting a Safeway card." But part of it I feel like
maybe I'm helping a little. Plus, it's kind of exciting. You never
know what's going to happen. (Participant)
One of us might be the clue. But just in these years, all of a
sudden--you know, it's gone from a small study . . . to be
enormous . . . We're all getting older, a lot of us 'cause Ronald
Regan had the money to put into it, the whole foundation, but it
has changed so much since he was first diagnosed and died. But
it's just amazing the kinds of things that are out there, all because
people have gotten involved. (Participant)
They're all like really proud to be participating in a study that
they think is going to have an impact on other others who have
been dealt the same situation that they've been dealt . . . That's
pretty significant. (Researcher)
Theme 3: Caregiver Concerns
Family members'desire for information about the patient and
possibly heritable conditions emerged as particularly strong
motivation to keep participants in studies. Other motivators
included caregivers' desire to help family members, and the
respite caregivers had during patients' long study appoint-
ments. Conversely, difficulty accepting patients'diagnoses or
lack of useful information emerged as reasons family caregiv-
ers and patients might drop out of studies. Family caregivers
who were juggling jobs and family obligations were some-
times unable to meet study obligations. Transportation and
motivation were of particular importance to caregivers.
Researchers described the difficulty caregivers have getting
sicker patients, or those with mental health issues or increas-
ing dementia, to study sites as a substantial barrier:
I think sometimes it makes it more difficult to travel when you
have somebody that might, you know, not be very agreeable to
sitting for long periods of time on a plane or that they feel like
they can control. (Researcher)
Researchers who worked with HIV+ participants men-
tioned that older HIV+ adults sometimes do not have family
or steady paid caregivers, making scheduling and participa-
tion in research difficult. Moreover, patients' declining cog-
nition could also change the way study personnel interact
with research participants and their caregivers. Researchers
acknowledged the need to address this with staff training and
sensitivity:
It's better to call the caregiver because it's more likely that
you'll get the appointment scheduled and they'll actually come.
But at the same time, you know, the [early dementia] patient
realizes that you're not calling them to schedule that appointment
and gets offended that you didn't call them. So it's kind of tricky
to navigate . . . And even the family member might be like,
"Why are you calling me to schedule this?" You know, like
they're semi in denial about what's going on or how much they
need to help out. (Researcher)
Overall, it appears that caregivers experience facilitators
and barriers similar to those experienced by research partici-
pants. However, the focus group discussions highlighted the
additional burdens of assisting with the study participation of
sick or cognitively impaired research participants.
Theme 4: Physical and Social Environment
Focus group discussions frequently focused on characteris-
tics of the physical and social environment, and how these
might affect study participation. On-site parking was gener-
ally described as an important factor for those who had a car
and drove to the sites. Accessibility is a product of site loca-
tion and the built environment, but it was also discussed as a
function of transportation options, cultural differences, par-
ticipants' level of disability, and caregiver burden. One par-
ticipant emphasized that even with parking, it was difficult to
arrive on-site:
I have a problem with walking. It would be real nice if somebody
could pick me up. I know that's not feasible though. So if I'm
parking in a garage, I have to come across the street. I have to
carry this [oxygen] everywhere I go . . . yeah, so, you know, I do
what I can. But it would be helpful if I could do a whole lot by
phone, a whole lot more by telephone. (Participant)
Participants and researchers repeatedly said that physi-
cally attractive, clean, welcoming study sites encouraged
continued participation. Site B, where many participants are
homeless or marginally housed, also provides a place where
participants could come by just to relax, chat, have a cup of
tea, or make a phone call; participants said that because of
this they sometimes even came by in-between study visits.
At the same time, many participants said that study visits
conducted in unpleasant rooms and sites without comfort-
able waiting areas were disrespectful or made them feel
unappreciated. In studies with marginalized and socially dis-
advantaged target populations, researchers and participants
said that "official looking" or intimidating research sites, for
example, those where participants had to interact with secu-
rity personnel or show identification to enter, could discour-
age continued participation in the research that takes place
there.
Institutional reputation emerged as both a participation
barrier and a facilitator. Participants mentioned the universi-
ty's role as a leading research and medical institution as an
incentive to participation. Some researchers noted that previ-
ous negative interactions between academia and the commu-
nity sometimes made it difficult to enroll and retain
participants. Participants explicitly described perceived
institutional systemic conflicts of interest as disincentives:

They discovered in the last few years that professors are getting
paid or some information's being slanted or they're leaving out
some information. It's not a clean line. I don't want them to say,
"Oh, let's take the best 80% that it worked well on, ignore the 20
that it didn't work well on and then we can go to the FDA."
(Participant)
Crosscutting Issues
Issues related to funding, flexibility, and relationships were
common to all of the major themes that emerged in our study.
Researchers said that funding policies and budgetary con-
straints and cuts reduce study resources and staffing levels.
This in turn can affect study design and implementation, lim-
iting follow-up protocols, staff availability, and sometimes
even reducing investigators' inclination to enroll potentially
hard-to-find participants into their studies. According to
some focus group participants, when studies limited follow-
up visits to weekdays, it caused them to miss visits or drop
out of studies when their employment or personal situation
changed. Limited resources can result in smaller-than-ideal
sample sizes because large cohorts require more effort for
recruitment, data collection, and follow-up. Moreover, strin-
gent rules, for example, those found in multicenter projects
involving large consortia or National Institutes of Health
(NIH)­funded studies, sometimes denied investigators the
flexibility to quickly adjust study visit time windows and
retention protocols in response to the needs of the study and
the participants:
So there was a time . . . maybe just four years ago, that you could
manipulate the participant incentive budget to allocate a few
hundred dollars for unique transfers or taxi vouchers or food or
something like that. But [the university] was audited . . . and we
were told we could no longer--even though it was going towards
the participant use--do it unless it was itemized in the budget.
(Researcher)
Sustained contact, personal touches, and the relationships
these engender emerged as important factors in the ability of
researchers to respond to participants' needs in scheduling,
transportation, and the desire for information. Researchers
said that good communication among principal investiga-
tors, coordinators, staff, and site directors provided impor-
tant avenues of feedback about which retention procedures
worked and which did not. On-the-ground research staff said
that this was particularly important when studies were led by
less-experienced principal investigators and on studies
designed with limited retention protocols. Respect, or the
perceived lack of it, was described as affecting confidence
and trust. Participants repeatedly said or implied that it was
important that they not be "treated like a number," and that
they want to be treated with respect. Perceived lack of respect
by members of the study team negatively affected their con-
fidence and trust in the research process. Researchers made
frequent reference to the importance of respect and personal
connection with participants:
I found that the people . . . who I followed up with on the phone
after to give them test results or just to check in and make sure,
you know, their hospice was working out or make sure their
Medicare benefits were coming through, whatever it may be,
they feel a tie to us . . . so then two months later, when I ask,
"Would you be willing to come back? I know he's in a wheelchair
now and it's going to be difficult but it would be really helpful
for us," they're more likely to do that. (Researcher)
Researchers recognized the crucial importance of
acknowledging participants as individuals. They also
described individual characteristics such as education,
income, cultural background, disability, or health status as
important but not themselves necessarily barriers to
retention:
I want to say that there's an easy equation to determine who
would be difficult to get and who would be easy, but I don't
think there is . . . Some folks, they are marginally housed. They
may move around a lot, but they have a really good relationship
with their case manager and we know there's someone we can
call. Some people . . . go to the library and they check their
email. So the fact of someone's housing situation or situation in
terms of needing care doesn't fully predict their ability to be
retained in the study. (Researcher)
Discussion
Their comments show that researchers and research partici-
pants think in concrete, practical terms about transportation,
incentives and motivation, caregiver burden, and the effects
of the physical and social environment on research participa-
tion. Moreover, the discussions illustrated how participant-,
study-, and contextual-level characteristics interact to
encourage or hinder participation in research over time.
Attendees in all focus groups saw participant SES as relevant
to the ability of studies to retain participants. They often
cited income, education, and culture when discussing the
relative ease of participation in research, and the importance
of monetary and nonmonetary incentives to lower income
and higher income participants. High disease severity and
comorbidity and related burdens were described as substan-
tial participation barriers, particularly when family resources
were scarce. Transportation issues, mentioned frequently by
participants, might affect not only study participation but
also patients' ability to travel to medical appointments and
adhere to medical treatment. Differential attrition of sicker
research participants who also have transportation barriers
could thus bias study outcomes. In an individual car-based
culture with inconvenient and increasingly expensive public
transit, the inability of poor and marginalized individuals to
simply get from one place to another can present a broader
barrier to their functioning than is commonly imagined.
Odierna and Bero 9
Conversely, access to and reimbursement for safe and conve-
nient transportation can facilitate continued study participa-
tion. Transportation issues also might change with age;
patients' need to stop driving, which has been linked to poor
health outcomes including declining cognitive function
(O'Connor, Edwards, Small, & Andel, 2011), can reduce
individuals' ability to continue to participate in studies, and
change the representativeness of cohorts over time.
Most of the barriers and facilitators that our focus group
participants identified are not simply due to characteristics of
research participants. Rather, they seem to result from inter-
actions between characteristics of study participants and the
larger research environment, which in combination can affect
retention rates over time. This dynamic appears similar to
processes in which physical limitations interact with condi-
tions in the social and physical environment to limit full par-
ticipation in society by older adults or people with disabilities
(Satariano, 2005). Just as appropriate accommodations
improve social participation for those populations, adjust-
ments to funding policies, study design and implementation,
and site accessibility could improve participant retention in
health research. Researchers, from data collectors to principal
investigators, frequently described inadequate funding and
resource allocation as participation barriers because of their
effects on study protocols (e.g., recruitment and retention pro-
cedures) and interaction with participants (e.g., staffing lev-
els,studyvisitscheduling,sustainedcontactwithparticipants).
In particular, researchers often mentioned strict funding regu-
lations as limiting the flexibility they need to achieve high
retention rates. While it is not news when investigators com-
plain about lack of adequate funding for any aspect of their
projects, the focus group discussions illuminated specific
ways funding policies can affect study design and implemen-
tation, and how these in turn can affect retention.
To our knowledge, our study is unique in that we asked
both researchers and research participants to identify factors
specifically related to the retention of participants in pro-
spective studies. We also encouraged broad discussion of
multilevel barriers and facilitators. Some of our findings
reflect previous reports of relationships between loss to fol-
low-up and participant characteristics including low SES,
distance from the research site, or co-morbidities, and study
characteristics, including insufficient follow-up protocols or
high participant burden (Davis et al., 2002; Hessol et al.,
2001; Sharma, Tobin, & Brant, 1986). Unlike our study,
Davis et al. (2002) found that the implementation of multiple
follow-up strategies was the most important factor in achiev-
ing high retention rates regardless of the population being
studied. Our findings that relationships, including elements
of trust, cultural competence, and participants' wariness of
financial conflicts of interest, are crucial to participant reten-
tion are consistent with previous studies that found these to
be important factors in peoples' willingness to enroll in
research (Chao et al., 2011; Dilworth-Anderson, 2011;
Kirkby, Calvert, Draper, Keeley, & Wilson, 2012; Manson,
Garroutte, Goins, & Henderson, 2004). A focus group study
with African American research participants found that a
lack of trust in scientific research, academic institutions, and
researchers themselves, as well as the failure of researchers
to share their findings with the community, were participa-
tion barriers regardless of SES or education (Williams et al.,
2010). The high value of altruism, salience, and developing
good relationships between researchers and participants con-
firms similar findings by Kost et al. (2011), whose study of
the overall experience of research participants and people in
various roles of research enterprise found those factors to be
of more importance than financial compensation. That study
also found that participants were dissatisfied when research
staff did not share test results with study participants or study
findings with the larger community.
We and others have found that caregivers often play an
important role in participation through all phases of research.
Caregiving can cause physical and emotional stress and
affect the health of family members, particularly older adults
caring for disabled relatives (Perkins et al., 2013; Schulz &
Beach, 1999). An analysis of a cohort of dementia patients
found associations between study dropout and nonfamily
caregiving and increased family caregiver burden, and con-
cluded that caregivers'well-being could be an important fac-
tor in retaining dementia patients (Coley et al., 2008). Our
findings indicate that the burdens of managing the research
participation of a physically or cognitively impaired adult
can form substantial participation barriers for family care-
givers who work and have conflicting responsibilities.
Limitations
A limitation of focus group research is that the sample might
not represent the population of interest. As in most focus
group research, participants in this research were self-
selected, and the researchers and study subjects we talked
with might not be typical of such groups in other venues. In
this project, we had a special concern that hard-to-retain
respondents and dropouts might self-select out of the sample.
To address this, we made a special effort to recruit study
dropouts, and we included a center that serves marginalized,
poor, homeless, minority, and HIV+ individuals, and people
who experience substance abuse and mental disabilities--
populations long considered to be hard to reach for enroll-
ment and follow-up (Badawi, Eaton, Myllyluoma, Weimer,
& Gallo, 1999; BootsMiller et al., 1998; Cottler, Compton,
Ben-Abdallah, Horne, & Claverie, 1996; DiFranceisco et al.,
1998; Hessol et al., 2001). Moreover, the focus group format
and convenience sampling generate rich information not eas-
ily found using other research designs (Creswell, 2007).
Because we were aware that our interpretive analysis of par-
ticipants' descriptions of research participation could be col-
ored by our own experiences as researchers, we used
informant feedback throughout the study to increase
reliability.
Other limitations result from the nature of our study
design. We had access to study participants and expert
10 SAGE Open
researchers in several research centers; this access provided
multidimensional perspectives. However, our study took
place at one institution, which limits generalizability. Our
findings are based on the perceptions and experiences of
researchers and participants in a wide range of health studies.
We had no access to study records and were unable to verify
details of the studies they described. We are unable to report
differences by race/ethnicity, gender, or age. These gaps pro-
vide roadmaps for future mixed-methods studies and studies
that focus on particular participant populations.
Implications for Research Policy and Practice
Recently, there has been substantial focus on patient-cen-
tered health outcomes in health care research and delivery.
Study designs that take into account patient- or participant-
centered research outcomes could maximize recruitment and
retention. This is not amenable to a one-size-fits-all approach;
patient-centered health and research outcomes depend on the
priorities of the study population and policymakers who seek
to address them equitably and efficiently. These priorities
might include, for example, relieving the burden of disease
for individuals and communities, addressing social health
determinants, providing information and resources, or widely
disseminating or implementing findings. The latter might be
a particularly important motivation for participation in
research. Our findings regarding nonmonetary incentives
indicate that many research participants of all SES levels are
motivated to enroll and stay in studies they believe to be sci-
entifically or socially important, but that financial compensa-
tion is an effective motivator for many others.
Relationships between researchers and research partici-
pants are pivotal in maintaining high retention rates.
However, investigators cannot address every issue at every
level. Structural and institutional barriers may be over-
whelming, especially when research policies or inadequate
funding limit retention strategies available to investigators.
To attain high response rates in diverse study populations, it
might be effective to evaluate the impact of individual,
study, and social factors, and develop approaches tailored to
target populations and communities. For example, Williams
et al. (2010) argue that pervasive barriers to African
American participation in Alzheimer's disease research can
be overcome if researchers maintain a durable presence in
the community. Research in Native American communities
sometimes requires formal collaboration with tribal authori-
ties (Manson et al., 2004). Integrating the needs and prefer-
ences of the individuals, communities, and populations
involved in research also requires funders' and policymak-
ers' willingness to provide resources for effective, flexible,
and culturally competent retention protocols. Prospective
studies of retention of socially disadvantaged, disabled, or
other clinically relevant populations, discussions with key
informants, or the addition of questions on national surveys
or and study visit questionnaires are examples of strategies
that could provide important information to investigators
and funders alike. Changes in research policy cannot elimi-
nate the effects of contextual factors or social disadvantage
on participant retention; however, they can make research
more inclusive and relevant to diverse and aging
populations.
