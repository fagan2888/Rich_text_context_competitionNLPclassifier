Abstract
Objective: To investigate the incidence and risk factors for emergence agitation in the
postanaesthetic care unit (PACU), in adult patients undergoing urological surgery.
Methods: Medical records were retrospectively reviewed. Preoperative, intraoperative and
postoperative variables were evaluated. Emergence agitation was defined as a Riker sedation­
agitation score !5. Logistic regression analysis was used to determine independent risk factors for
emergence agitation.
Results: Emergence agitation was observed in 48/488 (9.8%) patients. Chronic lung disease (odds
ratio [OR] 2.72, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.03, 7.17), duration of surgery (OR 1.01, 95% CI
1.00, 1.01), history of social drinking (OR 2.48, 95% CI 1.25, 4.93), postoperative pain score (OR
1.32, 95% CI 1.14, 1.53), voiding urgency (OR 2.20, 95% CI 1.01, 4.77) and presence of gastric tube
(OR 2.85, 95% CI 1.07, 7.54) were independent risk factors for emergence agitation.
Conclusions: Adequate postoperative pain management and prevention of catheter-related
bladder discomfort may be helpful in reducing the incidence of emergence agitation in urology
patients.

Introduction
Emergence agitation in the postanaesthesia
care unit (PACU) is a common complication
after general anaesthesia, and can necessi-
tate physical or chemical restraint in order
to avoid serious consequences for the
patient (e.g. physical injury, increased pain,
haemorrhage, removal of catheters).1
Considerable effort by the entire medical
team is required to ensure the safety of
both the patient with emergence agitation
and their attending staff members.2
Postoperative emergence agitation is asso-
ciated with cognitive deficit, and increased
physical dependence, duration of hospital
stay and in-hospital mortality.3
Few studies have examined emergence
agitation in adults, and there are no diag-
nostic criteria or clear definitions for this
condition due to its heterogeneous clinical
presentation.4,5 Identified risk factors for
emergence agitation in adults include the use
of doxapram, premedication with benzodi-
azepines, anaesthetic induction with etomi-
date, severe postoperative pain, oral cavity
and otolaryngological surgery, breast sur-
gery, abdominal surgery, extended surgical
duration and presence of a tracheal tube or
urinary catheter.1,4,5 The nature of uro-
logical surgery requires the postoperative
insertion of urinary catheters in the majority
of patients, and such devices are associated
with complications including catheter-
related bladder discomfort (CRBD; defined
as voiding urgency),6,7 which can be a risk
factor for emergence agitation.1 Little data
are available regarding the risk of emergence
agitation after urological surgery specific-
ally, since the majority of studies include
such patients as a subgroup in a larger
surgical study population.1,5
The aim of this retrospective study was to
determine the incidence of emergence agita-
tion in adult patients after general anaesthe-
sia for urological surgery. The association
between emergence agitation and CRBD
was examined, and additional perioperative
variables were evaluated as risk factors for
emergence agitation in this patient group.
Patients and methods
Study population
This retrospective study included adult
patients (aged 20­90 years) with American
Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) physical
status 1­3, admitted to the PACU after
elective urological surgery under general
anaesthesia with an endotracheal tube or a
supraglottic airway device at Seoul National
University Hospital, Seoul, Republic of
Korea between March 2012 and August
2012. Patients' electronic medical records
were reviewed by two board-certified anaes-
thetists (E.K. and H.C.K.) and one resident
anaesthetist (J.H.S.). Exclusion criteria were:
neurological disease potentially associated
with symptoms of agitation or intellectual
disability; transfer to intensive care unit.
The study was approved by the
Institutional Review Board of Seoul
National University Hospital, Seoul,
Republic of Korea, and the requirement
for patient consent was waived.
General anaesthesia
All patients received controlled mechanical
ventilation during general anaesthesia; no
patient was premedicated. Anaesthesia was
induced with 2 mg/kg propofol or 5 mg/kg
thiopental and maintained with: (i) inhal-
ation anaesthesia (1­4 vol% sevoflurane or
4­8 vol% desflurane, and intermittent
0.5­1 mg/kg fentanyl injection); or (ii) intra-
venous anaesthesia (continuous effect site
concentration: 3­5 mg/ml propofol and effect
site concentration: 2­5 ng/ml remifentanil
infusion using a target-controlled infusion
device [Orchestra; Fresenius-Vial, Brezins,
France]). Intubation was facilitated via
0.8 mg/kg rocuronium intravenous injection
or I-gelÕ (Intersurgical, Wokingham, UK;
used in some patients undergoing
Kim et al. 227
endoscopic surgery such as transurethral
resection of bladder tumour).
Neuromuscular blockade was maintained
via intermittenr 0.03­0.05 mg/kg vecuro-
nium. About 20 min before the end of
surgery, 30 mg ketorolac was administrated
for pain relief in patients without a patient-
controlled analgesia (PCA) device. The
majority of patients with a PCA received
0.3 mg ramosetron (majority of patients) or
0.075 mg palonosetron (three patients) and
opioid-based intravenous PCA (20­30 mg/kg
fentanyl and 0.3 mg ramosetron; total
volume 100 ml, loading 1 ml, basal infusion
rate 1­2 ml/hr, bolus 0.5­1 ml, lockout time
15 min). At the end of surgery, residual
neuromuscular blockade was reversed with
0.05 mg/kg neostigmine and 0.02 mg/kg
atropine. Most patients were extubated in
the operating room and transferred to the
PACU. No patient received epidural cath-
eterization for intraoperative or postopera-
tive pain control.
Postoperative assessment
Emergence agitation was assessed in the
PACU by attending anaesthetic nurses
using the Riker sedation­agitation score.8
Emergence agitation was defined as a Riker
score !5 at any time in the PACU.
Postoperative pain was assessed by attend-
ing anaesthetic nurses using an 11-point
numerical rating scale (0, no pain; 10,
worst imaginable pain) on admission to
(and discharge from) the PACU. Pain
score was also assessed whenever patients
asked for pain medication. If the pain score
was !4, 50­100 mg fentanyl was adminis-
tered as rescue medicine. The maximum
pain score was included in the analysis.
Nausea, vomiting, shivering and dizziness
were also assessed at the time of pain
assessment in PACU. Patients with moder-
ate-to-severe nausea and vomiting were
given 4 mg ondansetron (patients without
intraoperative ramosetron administration)
or 1 mg/kg dexamethasone (patients with
intraoperative ramosetron administration).
Patients with moderate-to-severe shivering
were given 25 mg pethidine. Haemodynamic
and respiratory parameters were assessed to
find correctable factors when severe dizzi-
ness was detected. Patients were discharged
from the PACU if they were conscious, had
a pain score of 3, stable vital signs for
30 min and no shivering, bleeding, nausea or
vomiting.
Data collection
Data were retrieved from patient electronic
medical charts and categorized into pre-,
intra- and postoperative variables.
Preoperative variables included: demo-
graphics; ASA physical status; history of
smoking and social drinking; educational
state; nil-by-mouth duration; serum albu-
min; and surgical history within 3 months.
Intraoperative variables included: surgical
site; endoscopic surgery (such as transureth-
ral resection of ureter stones, or bladder and
prostate lesions); anaesthetic induction
agent (propofol or thiopental); airway
instrument (endotracheal tube or I-gelÕ);
anaesthesia maintenance agent (sevoflurane
or desflurane or intravenous anaesthesia);
nitrous oxide use; antiemetic use; transfu-
sion; remifentanil continuous infusion; total
intraoperative opioid dose (remifentanil
dose was converted to equivalent dose of
fentanyl with a ratio of 1 : 19); duration of
surgery; duration of anaesthesia.
Postoperative variables included: postopera-
tive pain score; voiding urgency; nausea;
vomiting; shivering; dizziness. The presence
of a tracheal tube, urinary catheter and
gastric tube in PACU were also noted.
Statistical analyses
The incidence of emergence agitation in
patients undergoing urological surgery has
been reported as 4.1% in.1 The present study
228 Journal of International Medical Research 43(2)
required a minimum of 467 patients to
reproduce the incidence of emergence agita-
tion, with a two-sided 95% confidence
interval width of 3.6%.
Data were presented as mean Æ SD, n (%)
or median (interquartile range [IQR]).
Patients were stratified according to the
presence or absence of emergence agitation.
Student's t-test and 2 or Fisher's exact test
(if the number in a cell was less than five)
were used for between-group comparisons of
continuous and categorical variables,
respectively. Variables with P-values <0.1
in the primary test were included in binary
logistic regression to identify independent
risk factors for emergence agitation.
Statistical analyses were performed using
SPSSÕ version 19.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL,
USA) for WindowsÕ. P-values <0.05 were
considered to indicate statistical significance.
Results
The study enrolled 494 patients, of whom six
were excluded because of transfer to the
surgical intensive care unit. The final ana-
lysis included 488 patients (399 [81.8%]
male/89 [18.2%] female; mean age 61 Æ 14
years; age range 20­90 years). Emergence
agitation (Riker sedation­agitation score
!5) was observed in 48 patients (9.8%)
(Table 1). Patients with emergence agitation
were managed with light sedation with
propofol (1 patient, 2.1%), analgesia (25
patients, 52.1%), reassurance (15 patients,
31.3%), propofol plus analgesic (1 patient,
2.1%), and analgesic plus reassurance (6
patients, 12.5%). Two patients self-extu-
bated in the PACU and one required
reintubation because of desaturation.
Demographic and preoperative charac-
teristics of the patient group, stratified
according to the presence or absence of
emergence agitation, are given in Table 2.
Rates of male sex, chronic respiratory dis-
ease and history of social drinking were
significantly higher in patients with emer-
gence agitation than in those without
(P ¼ 0.028, P ¼ 0.027 and P ¼ 0.003, respect-
ively; Table 2). There were no statistically

Discussion
The present study found that emergence
agitation in the PACU occurred in around
10% of patients undergoing urological sur-
gery, and was associated with voiding
urgency (CRBD). A long duration of sur-
gery, history of social drinking, presence of a
gastric tube, chronic lung disease and severe
postoperative pain were predictive of emer-
gence agitation.

Studies regarding postoperative emer-
gence agitation have evaluated paediatric
patients in the operating room or the
PACU,10­12 and few have examined adult
patients in either setting. The overall inci-
dence of emergence agitation was reported
to be 5% in two large-scale PACU-based
prospective studies using the Riker sed-
ation­agitation scale and Richmond agita-
tion and sedation scale, respectively.1,4
Subgroup analyses indicated the incidence
of emergence agitation was 4.1% in adult
urology patients.1 A further study that
evaluated emergence agitation using a
three-point scale reported that 21.3% of
patients developed postoperative emergence
agitation in the PACU,5 with subgroup
analysis indicating the incidence in urology
patients to be 13.6%.5 These differences may
be explained by variations in surgical site,
the scale used for patient assessment, inter-
observer agreement and possible
underestimation as a result of retrospective
study design.
The presence of a urinary catheter is a
known risk factor for emergence agitation.5
All patients who experienced postoperative
emergence agitation in the present study had
a urinary catheter, and CRBD was asso-
ciated with an increased risk of emergence
agitation. The incidence of postoperative
CRBD has been reported at 58­90% in
urology patients, with 45­60% of these
patients experiencing moderate-to-severe
symptoms.13,14 Male sex and a large diam-
eter Foley catheter are independent risk
factors for CRBD.15 The majority of
patients in the present study were male and
had a Foley catheter inserted postopera-
tively, putting them at high risk of CRBD. It
is necessary to reduce CRBD in these
patients in order to prevent emergence agi-
tation. Early removal of the Foley catheter
will reduce patient discomfort.

Pharmacological prevention or treatment
(using gabapentin, tramadol, ketamine or
butylscopolamine) decreases the incidence
of CRBD in the PACU.6,7,13,16
In a finding consistent with others,4,5,17
postoperative pain was a risk factor for
emergence agitation in the present study.
Poor postoperative pain management is
known to increase postoperative morbidity.
Pain can be managed by various means,18­20
and adequate postoperative pain control is
necessary to reduce emergence agitation.
In contrast to others,1,5 we found that
chronic lung disease was an independent risk
factor for emergence agitation. Studies in
patients with lung cancer, however, demon-
strated that pneumonia is associated with
hyperactive delirium.21 Acute hypoxia or
hypercapnia due to lung disease may result
in additional postoperative stress, increasing
the risk of emergence agitation.
Alcohol use is a risk factor for post-
operative delirium.22­24 This is consistent
with our finding that a history of social
drinking was a risk factor for emergence
agitation. This may be due to acute with-
drawal of alcohol during the perioperative
period.
Duration of surgery was associated with
emergence agitation in the present study and
those of others.1 Although it is considered a
nonpreventable factor, using a surgical
training programme that can increase the
skill of the associated medical staff may
reduce the duration of surgery. Moreover,
close communication and co-operation
among medical teams may be necessary to
reduce any unnecessary delays during sur-
gery. The presence of a gastric tube was also
associated with increased postoperative
emergence agitation in the present study.
Similar to a urinary catheter, a nasogastric
tube can distress a patient during anaesthetic
emergence by stimulating the gag reflex.
Therefore, to diminish patient discomfort,
the nasogastric tube should be removed as
early as possible.
Despite the significantly higher incidence
of emergence agitation in male patients than
female patients in the present study, male
sex was not an independent risk factor. The
role of sex as a risk factor for emergence
agitation remains unclear, with some studies
reporting that male sex is a risk factor5 and
others that it is not.1,4 The high proportion
of male patients in the present study (81.8%)
limits the usefulness of our findings.
In our hospital, large Foley catheters are
used in transurethral resection of bladder
and prostate lesions to facilitate postopera-
tive bladder irrigation and prevent obstruc-
tion of the catheter due to blood clots. We
expected that the incidence of emergence
agitation would be higher in patients
undergoing endoscopic surgery because a
Foley catheter with large diameter and con-
tinuous bladder stimulation with irrigation
fluids is associated with CRBD. In contrast
to our expectation, patients undergoing
endoscopic urological surgery had a lower
incidence of emergence agitation than those
undergoing nonendoscopic surgery,
although surgery type was not an independ-
ent risk factor in multivariate analysis.
Postoperative emergence agitation can
result in serious complications, and self-
extubation can lead to arterial hypoxaemia
or aspiration pneumonia. In this study, one
patient required reintubation in the PACU
because of desaturation after self-extuba-
tion. It is most important to protect patients
from self-injury, even before the cause of
emergence agitation is identified. Once the
cause is identified it should be immediately
resolved. If this is not possible (e.g. removal
of a urinary catheter in patients needing
postoperative urine output monitoring),
reassurance and pharmacological treatment
can reduce the incidence of emergence agi-
tation related to CRBD.
Our study has several limitations. First,
the retrospective nature of the investigation
meant that there were limitations in the data
available. There was insufficient information
Kim et al. 233
related to preoperative anxiety, preoperative
benzodiazepine administration for pre-
medication or the use of intravenous anaes-
thetic agents for anaesthetic maintenance to
allow us to evaluate their effects on emer-
gence agitation in full. Preoperative anxiety,
premedication with benzodiazepines and
intraoperative use of an inhalation agent
are known risk factors for emergence
agitation.1,4,5,17 Secondly, all study partici-
pants were undergoing urological surgery
and CRBD is associated with an increased
risk of emergence agitation. Thus, our
findings may not be applicable to other
surgical patients, particularly those who do
not require intraoperative urinary catheter-
ization. Thirdly, we used the Riker sed-
ation­agitation score to evaluate emergence
agitation. To our knowledge, there is no
gold standard for diagnosis and other
parameters such as the Richmond agita-
tion­sedation scale can be used instead.
In addition, there was no causal relationship
between postoperative variables and emer-
gence agitation. Rescue medications (such as
fentanyl for postoperative pain relief, antie-
metics for moderate-to-severe nausea and
vomiting, and pethidine for shivering) can
alter the incidence of emergence agitation.
Caution is therefore needed in interpreting
our results. Finally, this study focused on
postoperative emergence agitation, not
hypoactive emergence. Eight (1.6%) of our
patients were highly sedated or unarousable
in the PACU: these might be considered to
be cases of hypoactive emergence. Risk
factors for hypoactive emergence were not
analysed in this study because of the small
number of cases.
In conclusion, emergence agitation occur
in around 10% of adult patients undergoing
urological surgery. Chronic lung disease, a
history of social drinking, voiding urgency
due to an indwelling Foley catheter, long
duration of surgery, inadequate postopera-
tive pain control and presence of a gastric
tube were associated with emergence
agitation. Adequate postoperative pain
management and prevention of CRBD
may be helpful in reducing the incidence of
emergence agitation in urology patients.
